Phil (2013-10-01 14:55): oh damn

Xander (2013-10-01 14:56): Hello fellow socially well-adjusted individuals
Mark (2013-10-01 14:56): *farts*
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:56): Was annoying trying to come up w/ the damn name lol
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:56): That's what took so long actually
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:56) (2x <3): Lemme go get lumi
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-01 14:57): James Yoo added Nathan Ewing to the group
Phil (2013-10-01 14:57): okay I have too many damn chats I'm leaving tonight
Mark (2013-10-01 14:58) (1x <3): this is not a chat you simply leave
Mark (2013-10-01 14:58): oh no
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:58): So if you feel like adding someone else, feel free.  It's a democracy
Xander (2013-10-01 14:58): I think he meant Tonight
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:58): Lol
Phil (2013-10-01 14:59): I meant Tonight and then some
Xander (2013-10-01 14:59): Yeah, I never see anything worthwhile in the Tonight chat. It's just a bunch of bs
Phil (2013-10-01 14:59): I'm thinking there's no real point to red pill game chat either
Phil (2013-10-01 14:59): sorry Xan
Phil (2013-10-01 14:59): nothing happens in there
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:59): Okay, a couple ground rules if I may
James Yoo (2013-10-01 14:59) (2x <3): Rule #1: Don't talk about Closers
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:00) (1x <3): Haha but for real, I prefer if the GothamLife gays don't know about it
Xander (2013-10-01 15:00) (1x <3): Yeah, that's because I'm too busy espousing that shit in real life Phil
Phil (2013-10-01 15:00): sounds good Jimmy
Xander (2013-10-01 15:01): Okay, time to shut down Red Pill chat, since this is basically what it was supposed to be
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:01): Rule 2: if you want to add a new member, at least 1 other existing member must have met him and vouch for him
Xander (2013-10-01 15:01): Just a more legit chat
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:01): I guess that's it for me
Xander (2013-10-01 15:01): Rule 3: Share your spoils. Everyone gets to take a turn
Xander (2013-10-01 15:02): j/k
Mark (2013-10-01 15:02) (1x <3): too late, its on record
Mark (2013-10-01 15:02) (1x <3): lets go airtight on a broad
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:02) (1x <3): Every member currently here, I've met in person more than once and can say that I'd gladly grab a beer with while shooting the shit.  Let's maintain the awesomeness.
Phil (2013-10-01 15:03): me too except for mark I haven't met him
Xander (2013-10-01 15:03): Yeah, I would like to meet Mark as well
Mark (2013-10-01 15:03): soon
Phil (2013-10-01 15:03): Hi mark
Mark (2013-10-01 15:03) (1x <3): good things come to those who wait
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:03) (2x <3): There are times when I want to post shit like "I'm going to x-and-x bar/club tonight, come join me!" ---- but I'm afraid Sandeep or Nilay will come.  So I end up going solo
Xander (2013-10-01 15:04) (1x <3): @Phil I still can't get that Sandeep face out of my head, back when he was sitting on that park bench next to those two girls for like 15 minutes
Phil (2013-10-01 15:04): lol ahhh the sad truth
Phil (2013-10-01 15:04): @Jimmy
Xander (2013-10-01 15:04): I have nightmares about that
Phil (2013-10-01 15:05): lmao ^
Phil (2013-10-01 15:05): okay I have a meeting
Phil (2013-10-01 15:05): bee arr bee
Xander (2013-10-01 15:05) (1x <3): Like... Not to be overly cruel, but I feel as if some of the GothamLife chumps have a touch of asperger's
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:06): Keywoard: "overly"
Mark (2013-10-01 15:06) (1x <3): its the industry in general
Mark (2013-10-01 15:06) (1x <3): attracts lepers
Mark (2013-10-01 15:06): ive met some classy motherfuckers though
Mark (2013-10-01 15:06): just gotta look in the right places
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:07) (2x <3): The really scary thing is, GothamLife is one of the most normal communities around given its size
Xander (2013-10-01 15:07): Oh, I'm super glad I found that group. I have met fucking awesome gents such as yourselves
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:08): Hm.  Should we do a Closers happy hour?
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:08): Would be good for you guys to meet Mark
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:08): And vice versa
Xander (2013-10-01 15:08): Probably. I like drinking
Mark (2013-10-01 15:08) (3x <3): ill put on my gimp suit, just for you folks
Xander (2013-10-01 15:09) (1x <3): Haha, and I'll put on my pimp suit
Mark (2013-10-01 15:09): did you just like your own comment
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:09): Sexcellent
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:09): LOLLL
Xander (2013-10-01 15:09): I misclicked, but yes, I am that narcissistic
Mark (2013-10-01 15:09) (1x <3): damn son, next level
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:27) (1x <3): I go take a nap and there are more chats :)
Xander (2013-10-01 15:28) (1x <3): I logged out of the red pill one. Shuttered its doors. That and Tonight
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:29): Welcome nate
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:29): And good morning
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:29): Thanks, morning
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:29): Feel free to change ur username
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:29): Well I think everyone here already knows my name anyway
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:29): Except Mark, he's a paranoid
Mark (2013-10-01 15:30): you mean, axe murderer
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:30): Both at once if you can believe
Xander (2013-10-01 15:30) (1x <3): That's okay, women are attracted to murderers
Phil (2013-10-01 15:30): true story ^
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:31): OK I need some suggestions on a good response.  Background: #closed her 3 wks ago, been texting here and there playfully, finally getting close to a meetup
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:31): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0b8b6d500cfe0131d18e7622e4322419

Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:32): "My body is made of cheese cake.  You didn't know?"
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:33): Haha that's pretty good
Nathan Ewing (2013-10-01 15:33): I'm not sure if that's a serious answer :)
Xander (2013-10-01 15:33) (2x <3): Alright, you asked the right person
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:33): "What if it's made of cheesecake?"
Xander (2013-10-01 15:34): lol, what a feeble shit test on her part
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:35): Yeah...shanghai chicks are such a pain man
Xander (2013-10-01 15:35): Uhhhh, just parsing shit off of the top of my head
Xander (2013-10-01 15:35): "Well, that would make you the first"
Xander (2013-10-01 15:37) (1x <3): "Oh no! I thought you had fine taste, but it seems I was wrong"
Xander (2013-10-01 15:37): I dunno
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:37) (1x <3): Hahaha I like that fine taste one
Mark (2013-10-01 15:37): "no, you're interested in what my body can do"
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-01 15:37): Nathan Ewing changed name to Nate
Xander (2013-10-01 15:38): I like demonstrating that you're disappointed in her
Xander (2013-10-01 15:38): For not recognizing your awesomeness
Mark (2013-10-01 15:39) (1x <3): as long as you reframe and dont answer it directly, cant go wrong
Xander (2013-10-01 15:39): I dunno if there is enough attraction built already to use Mark's line
Xander (2013-10-01 15:39): Though I like the spirit of it
Mark (2013-10-01 15:40): she introduced the word "body" to the convo... you can take it sexual if you want
Xander (2013-10-01 15:40) (3x <3): Yeah, but she just sounds kinda bitchy and entitled
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:41) (1x <3): Bitchy and entitled is correct
Xander (2013-10-01 15:41): I mean, she keeps talking about eating sweets. What is she, 14?
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:42) (1x <3): It's in her fucking shanghai programming to think that she's the shit
Xander (2013-10-01 15:42): Time for some traumatic de-programming.
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:42): Annoying...but also makes the chase more fun
Phil (2013-10-01 15:43) (1x <3): reverse engineer that hoe
Xander (2013-10-01 15:43) (1x <3): That's my favorite sexual technique
Nate (2013-10-01 15:43): Yeah that girl last night had the same bitch complex.  I learned a lot dealing with her though.
Mark (2013-10-01 15:43) (1x <3): sometimes they just suck at flirting
Mark (2013-10-01 15:43): and it comes across as bitch shield
Mark (2013-10-01 15:44): or aloofness
Phil (2013-10-01 15:44) (1x <3): this chat is much more interesting
Phil (2013-10-01 15:44): I have to say
Mark (2013-10-01 15:44) (1x <3): signal to noise ratio is much higher here
Xander (2013-10-01 15:44) (2x <3): I have been meeting too many sweet, nice girls lately. I need some Russian models, since my game is calibrated to DESTROY EGOS
Phil (2013-10-01 15:45) (2x <3): I'm seeing a russian model on Thurs
Xander (2013-10-01 15:45) (1x <3): Me too, because Ima hack your phone's camera
Phil (2013-10-01 15:45): and a bitchy stuck up girl aloof girl on wednesday
Phil (2013-10-01 15:45): that didn't make sense ^
Xander (2013-10-01 15:46): Is she aloof to other girls?
Phil (2013-10-01 15:46): ya'll know what I mean
Phil (2013-10-01 15:46): no just me
Phil (2013-10-01 15:46) (1x <3): I don't remember what she looks like
Phil (2013-10-01 15:46): actually I could use some advice on this
Xander (2013-10-01 15:46) (1x <3): Oh man... you're right. This chat is infinitely better
Phil (2013-10-01 15:47): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/2f17d6400d000131448c7272f943b706
Xander (2013-10-01 15:47) (1x <3): I'm probably gonna check GayLife once a week from now on
Phil (2013-10-01 15:47): okay bitchy entitled american
Phil (2013-10-01 15:47): who I met for 10 minutes at a bar
Phil (2013-10-01 15:47): 13th step
Xander (2013-10-01 15:48): On a tangent, are we hitting that up tonight or trying some new places?
Phil (2013-10-01 15:48) (1x <3): she's probably gorgeous because I didn't approach anyone below a 9 that night
Phil (2013-10-01 15:48): idk I can't decide right now ^
Phil (2013-10-01 15:49): I could just do 13th honestly
Phil (2013-10-01 15:49): its always a good time
Xander (2013-10-01 15:49) (1x <3): Like, I don't want to become too much of a regular there. It isn't the same as being a regular at Solas
Phil (2013-10-01 15:49) (1x <3): last time I hooked up with a gorgeous turkish girl
Phil (2013-10-01 15:49) (1x <3): so my hit rate is pretty decent
Xander (2013-10-01 15:49): Okay, first of all, I don't like the "I hope we get to do that :)" part of the text
Phil (2013-10-01 15:50): fuck... ^
Phil (2013-10-01 15:50): I mean the smiley I get
Xander (2013-10-01 15:50): Yeah, and I have almost hooked with with two different girls there
Xander (2013-10-01 15:50) (1x <3): But they were both ripped from my arms most untimely
Phil (2013-10-01 15:50): kay so some honest advice here
Phil (2013-10-01 15:50): about carly
Mark (2013-10-01 15:50) (4x <3): i try to always stay away from sentences that begin with "i hope..." or "i need..."
Phil (2013-10-01 15:51): "we should do that"
Xander (2013-10-01 15:51): Exactly. You aren't someone who hopes or wishes that things will work out, especially with hot girls. You are someone who is used to smashing high quality pussy, since you are a valuable man
Phil (2013-10-01 15:51): ya
Xander (2013-10-01 15:51): Also, agreeing is beta.
Xander (2013-10-01 15:52): lol, I mean, it doesn't really matter
James Yoo (2013-10-01 15:52): Mark
"i try to always stay away from sentences that begin with "i hope..." or "i need...""

Good.  Shit.
Xander (2013-10-01 15:52): But I like flinging shit at girls from the get-go
Phil (2013-10-01 15:52): "no its way better if we just keep talking on here and never meet"
Xander (2013-10-01 15:52): Also, I don't like saying her name
Xander (2013-10-01 15:52): For some reason
Phil (2013-10-01 15:53): my text game fucking blows
Xander (2013-10-01 15:53): Warmer... haha
Xander (2013-10-01 15:53): lol, did I show you the tinder close I did recently?
Phil (2013-10-01 15:53): nah you didn't
Phil (2013-10-01 15:53): moving forward with this girl
Phil (2013-10-01 15:53): what do you think
Phil (2013-10-01 15:54) (1x <3): if I don't meet her tomorrow I have my girl Ali that I'll prob bone so I don't really care
Xander (2013-10-01 15:54): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3584a5c00d010131a86f5aa200192d18

Phil (2013-10-01 15:55): damn Xander
Xander (2013-10-01 15:55): See, that's a situation where it's okay to say "I hope" because it's a neg
Xander (2013-10-01 15:56): Though I hate the word "neg"
Phil (2013-10-01 15:56): yea
Phil (2013-10-01 15:56): I mean its not really a neg
Phil (2013-10-01 15:56): or idk
Phil (2013-10-01 15:57): so I friended this random girl on FB and I've been messaging her stuff randomly she just responded
Phil (2013-10-01 15:57) (1x <3): are definitely cute guy ..but I have no idea who you are
Xander (2013-10-01 15:57): lol, that was such a short Tinder close
Phil (2013-10-01 15:57): shorter the better
Phil (2013-10-01 15:58) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/bff150800d010131eb742eb545ddabb4
Phil (2013-10-01 15:58): she's gorgeous too
Phil (2013-10-01 15:58): and russian
Xander (2013-10-01 15:59): Oh, I remember her
Phil (2013-10-01 15:59): yea
Xander (2013-10-01 16:00): Damnit, I missed typing "That's what she said" to "shorter the better"
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:01): OK , I just went with: " Oh reallyyy? So ur not into hot guys??"
Xander (2013-10-01 16:01): Not bad
Phil (2013-10-01 16:02) (1x <3): ight fuck Carly I'm gonna blow her off and meet Ali instead
Xander (2013-10-01 16:02): On Wednesday you mean
Phil (2013-10-01 16:02): yea
Xander (2013-10-01 16:02) (1x <3): We have business to attend to tonight. My trigger finger is itching
Xander (2013-10-01 16:03): If you have any psychological problems, if you're on any medication for anxiety or depression, I'm not interested, don't call me, okay? Bye.
Phil (2013-10-01 16:04): I sent FB bitch this
Phil (2013-10-01 16:04): haha I'm pretty sure we met in usq
but we should change this
Hi kate I'm phil
Xander (2013-10-01 16:06): Why didn't you go with a contro and say "Hi kate, I just wanna stick my dick between your titties while your twin sister sucks off my balls and whips me with a riding crop"
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:08): My favorite contro text of all time was probably before you all joined
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:09): Something like, if a girl doesn't respond back after 1 or 2 texts...
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:09) (3x <3): He liked to send "Can I call you!!"
Xander (2013-10-01 16:09): Hahahahaha
Xander (2013-10-01 16:09): That just made my day
Phil (2013-10-01 16:09): yikes
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:10): Yeah I couldn't believe it
Phil (2013-10-01 16:10): I mean I can't say that I've done much better in the past
Phil (2013-10-01 16:10): lol
Xander (2013-10-01 16:10) (1x <3): I'm gonna have to add that to my roster, along with "Wow, I just had to stop you, cuz you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen!" and "You're like a dream come true!"
James Yoo (2013-10-01 16:11): I wish we could have a "Best of Contro's Texts" list
Phil (2013-10-01 16:11): loll
Mark (2013-10-01 16:11) (1x <3): damn, reading all these shitty txts is making me more beta through osmosis
Phil (2013-10-01 16:11): do any of you guys get messaged on reddit about being a wing coaching w/e
Phil (2013-10-01 16:11): cause I do all the time
Xander (2013-10-01 16:12): Really? I haven't posted on reddit in months because of my two old accounts getting compromised
Phil (2013-10-01 16:12): ah yeah
Phil (2013-10-01 16:12): I'll comment on stuff and w/e
Xander (2013-10-01 16:12): I should probably make a new account
Phil (2013-10-01 16:12): in seddit
Phil (2013-10-01 16:12): and gotham seddit
Nate (2013-10-01 16:12) (2x <3): I got tired of askseddit being full of people asking how to get the girl back that friendzoned them
Xander (2013-10-01 16:12) (1x <3): But then again, I'm tired of little bitches hitting me up for advice
Xander (2013-10-01 16:13): I stopped reading seddit like a year ago when I discovered r/theredpill
Xander (2013-10-01 16:13): As in, when my game started drastically improving
Xander (2013-10-01 16:13): Seddit is too watered down and sanitized for mass consumption
Phil (2013-10-01 16:14) (1x <3): which is good ^ I'd rather everyone suck at game
Phil (2013-10-01 16:14) (1x <3): not to be selfish but I want all the bitches
Xander (2013-10-01 16:15) (1x <3): Yeah, seriously. We can't have everyone in society be an alpha male, or else civilization as we know it will collapse
Phil (2013-10-01 16:15) (2x <3): its a good thing most men don't have the commitment to do this
Nate (2013-10-01 16:15) (2x <3): I wouldn't worry about that.  Very few guys are willing to put in the effort to make it happen.
Xander (2013-10-01 16:15): Most men lack the commitment to do anything truly great
Phil (2013-10-01 16:16): well yae
Xander (2013-10-01 16:16): WE ARE NOT "MOST MEN"
Nate (2013-10-01 16:16) (2x <3): I still think I suck at this, but I haven't had a day in 3 weeks I wasn't gaming somehow.
Mark (2013-10-01 16:16) (3x <3): we are the 1%

James Yoo (2013-10-01 17:03): Poor guy  =(
James Yoo (2013-10-01 17:04) (2x <3): I have actually thought this exact thought a few times:

Notice a very mediocre asian girl.  "Hmmm...too easy.  Maybe I should #close her and give it to Contro"
Phil (2013-10-01 17:04) (1x <3): w/e some people are social retartd

Phil (2013-10-01 17:06): ah okay
Xander (2013-10-01 17:07): I'm meeting her tomorrow, but if she is still too awkward and shy for me to advance anything, I'm gonna forget about it
Xander (2013-10-01 17:07): Like, I had to PIN HER DOWN to get a small makeout
Xander (2013-10-01 17:07): She was really bad at kissing, too
Xander (2013-10-01 17:08): Maybe she's retarded and I didn't pick up on it
Xander (2013-10-01 17:08) (1x <3): I hate it when chicks make almost 0% eye contact
Xander (2013-10-01 17:08): @Phil For contro, I was talking about Kitty Sun, hahaha

Xander (2013-10-01 17:52): from @DeathToHamsters

Girls: there are only 3 categories

Phil (2013-10-01 18:23) (1x <3): this isn't going to end well
Xander (2013-10-01 18:24): Alright... I'm going to get ready for this joke of a study group. I'm feelin the FIRE for tonight

Xander (2013-10-01 18:25) (1x <3): Once you've tasted of the nectar of the gods, it's impossible to be satisfied with gruel.
Phil (2013-10-01 18:26) (1x <3): I should just send her that
Xander (2013-10-01 18:26): Hahaha

Phil (2013-10-01 18:32): yay solid date on thursday
Xander (2013-10-01 18:32): Maybe I have irritable bowel syndrome, or maybe it's the hot chili peppers I eat for almost every meal
Phil (2013-10-01 18:32): hahah a little of both prob
Phil (2013-10-01 18:33): at least marcelle is pretty sane I don't think she'll knife me in my sleep
Phil (2013-10-01 18:33): although I could be wrong about that
Phil (2013-10-01 18:33) (1x <3): god damn I'm a fucking sociopath sometimes
Xander (2013-10-01 18:34): The difference between this chat and GayLyfe: we are routinely flaking on our dates rather than the other way around
Phil (2013-10-01 18:34): haha
Phil (2013-10-01 18:34): Ali can't meet me on Wed so its Carly or I'll stay in
Xander (2013-10-01 18:35): I think I have a mini golf date with awkward azn girl that my friend Erin pimped out to me
Xander (2013-10-01 18:35): On Wednesday
Xander (2013-10-01 18:36): We'll see how that bunch of bull goes

Xander (2013-10-02 10:21): Morning
Xander (2013-10-02 10:22): Phil and I went out to 13th Step again last night. I kiss/number closed girl, but Phil had a difficult night. We were both sort of out of sorts
Xander (2013-10-02 10:23) (1x <3): A must-read book just came out by one of the foremost authors in the manosphere: http://therationalmale.com/2013/09/30/the-rational-male/
Xander (2013-10-02 10:23) (1x <3): I'm going to charge through it and let you guys know what I think
Mark (2013-10-02 10:24): rational male is like CH, or less extreme
Xander (2013-10-02 10:24): Less extreme. He writes in a very academic and non-inflammatory way
Xander (2013-10-02 10:25): I have read through most of his collection of posts called Year One, and its excellent stuff
Mark (2013-10-02 10:26): interesting... will give it a read
Mark (2013-10-02 10:26) (1x <3): thx
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 10:34) (1x <3): Thxander
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 10:55): So update on shanghai chick
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 10:55): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/aba206b00da0013100c902795c29aa51
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:02): Shit how do I always end up w/ chicks w/ bf's?
Phil (2013-10-02 11:05): morning
Phil (2013-10-02 11:06) (1x <3): Just woke up.. Had a dream the NSA kidnapped me and were torturing me
Phil (2013-10-02 11:07): Pretty dark shit
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:07): Morning Phil. Sounds like erotica. Pls continue.
Nate (2013-10-02 11:07) (1x <3): @Phil disregard that dream.  You did not see me put anything in your head.  All is well.
Phil (2013-10-02 11:07): Loll ^
Phil (2013-10-02 11:10): When I dream they are always very  elaborate and narrative like
Xander (2013-10-02 11:11): @Jimmyayo Damn, shouldn't have used an abbrev! She hardly speaks Engrish
Phil (2013-10-02 11:11): How was my couch xan man
Xander (2013-10-02 11:11) (1x <3): It was a dream come true
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:13): Xander, so I'm thinking right now is a good time to preemptively set the friend-zone boundary
Xander (2013-10-02 11:13): For Shanghai chick?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:13): Instead of continuing to flirt
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:13): Yah
Mark (2013-10-02 11:14): @Jimmy hate when that shit happens
Mark (2013-10-02 11:14): was chatting up this brazilian chick yday
Mark (2013-10-02 11:14) (1x <3): and 15min into the convo... she goes... ya i live with my bf of 3 yrs
Xander (2013-10-02 11:14): "Bitch, I don't currrrrrr!"
Mark (2013-10-02 11:15) (2x <3): i usually say "are you satisfied in the bedroom? maybe looking for something on the side?"
Mark (2013-10-02 11:15): that usually gets a laugh
Xander (2013-10-02 11:15): @Jimmyayo Do you want to friend-zone her because you're trying to add more ladies to your social circle?
Xander (2013-10-02 11:16): @Mark lol
Mark (2013-10-02 11:17): she slips in "he wants to marry me, i dont think im ready yet"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:17): If there is good rapport and attraction present, I'll either pretend I didn't hear anything or I'll be like, "That's cool" and keep talking without pausing
Mark (2013-10-02 11:17): if i work it, im sure i could hit it, but dont know if worth the effort
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:18) (1x <3): No more like reverse psychology/forbidden fruit thing, once someone says "u seem cool but let's just be friends" it can spike the buying temperature...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:18): OR
Xander (2013-10-02 11:18): Ah, I see
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:19): Just be cool/nonchalant and seem "safe" to hang out with in text, and save the flirting/escalation for the in-person
Xander (2013-10-02 11:20): I haven't really seen enough of your txt conversation with her to be an accurate judge, but it almost seems as if you're coming off as more goofy than seductive
Phil (2013-10-02 11:26) (2x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/eeb18b400da4013100c902795c29aa51
Phil (2013-10-02 11:26): Check out my new tinder match
Xander (2013-10-02 11:26): Female Patrick Bateman
Xander (2013-10-02 11:29): @Jimmyayo I know we have gone over some of this already, but I'll rehash for the sake of... education
Xander (2013-10-02 11:30): "Hey Jingle bells! Haha when r we finally going to grab a drink? This year I hope :)"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:34) (1x <3): 1. No exclamation mark. Demonstrates that you're overly eager

2. You're writing "haha", laughing at something she said that wasn't even funny, just her talking about why it took her so long to get home. Registers as supplicating, nervous laughter subconsciously.

3. You saying "I hope" shows her that you're already too emotionally invested, that combined with what I will call the nervous, supplicating smiley.
Xander (2013-10-02 11:35): "O that sounds delish. When u find it bring some to me"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:35): Not too much to nitpick here, except that you're still in the frame of validating her/agreeing with her choices
Xander (2013-10-02 11:36): "Lol sry cutie, busy tonight"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:38) (1x <3): I don't really understand this text, since she never explicitly asked if you wanted to hang out with her. I think it may have come across as a little weird, since it seems like you were pulling the "By the way, I'm a really busy guy, so I'm probably too busy to hang out if you are ever going to ask me to hang out"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:38): Which comes across as a little try-hard
Xander (2013-10-02 11:39): "Jing! Let's hang out Friday there's a great little spot I wanna take u"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:42) (1x <3): Again, lose the exclamation marks! Those things have to be EARNED rather than given out like candy. In addition, I think it would have been better if you had said something like "there's a cool spot I'm taking you." You don't WANT to take her there, you either ARE taking her there or you AREN'T, and you aren't trying too hard to convince her of how "great!!!" the place is
Xander (2013-10-02 11:43): "Well I'll be there, which is better than yoghurt  or cheesecake"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:45) (1x <3): You're playing into her frame here as an entitled princess and trying to qualify yourself as better than food items...
Xander (2013-10-02 11:46): "But you can't eat me lol"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:47) (1x <3): The "lol" registers as more nervous laughing at your own jokes
Xander (2013-10-02 11:48): The one line I really like so far is the "Oh reallyyy? So ur not into hot guys??"
Phil (2013-10-02 11:48) (1x <3): Damn xan analyze my shit next lol
Xander (2013-10-02 11:48): If every line you wrote was as irreverent as that one, should would be creaming her panties by now
Mark (2013-10-02 11:49): A+
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:49): Haha damn, good shit Xander
Xander (2013-10-02 11:49): One or two more remarks
Mark (2013-10-02 11:49) (2x <3): bottom line: always invest less than the girl
Mark (2013-10-02 11:49) (2x <3): match her investment level, then take it down a notch
Xander (2013-10-02 11:50): When she's like, "I'm into cool guys. Just kidding, I have a boyfriend"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:51) (1x <3): That was a perfect opportunity to purposely misconstrue her words
Xander (2013-10-02 11:52) (1x <3): Since she's basically like, "Just kidding, I don't hang out with cool guys since I have a lame boyfriend"
Xander (2013-10-02 11:55) (1x <3): Meh... don't really know what else to say. I think you know what you need to improve on Jimmyayo
Xander (2013-10-02 11:55): I'm just wondering what the real life interaction was like before all of this
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 11:56) (1x <3): Basically yes, thanks
Nate (2013-10-02 11:57): @Mark if you wanna do lunch tomorrow I'll be free
Mark (2013-10-02 11:58): lets do it
Nate (2013-10-02 11:58): cool
Nate (2013-10-02 11:58): @Xander you basically described one of my major sticking points when analyzing that...
Xander (2013-10-02 12:00): @Nate Which one?
Nate (2013-10-02 12:03) (1x <3): Being more invested than they are.  Falling into their frame.
Nate (2013-10-02 12:08) (2x <3): It's funny, I used to get depressed every time I'd screw up with a girl(s).  Then I'd go drink a whole lot and withdraw.  Now I just try to analyze what I did/didn't do and what I should read/learn/practice to improve it.
Xander (2013-10-02 12:09) (1x <3): Now I just drink so that I can tolerate women
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:09): Nate it's not a big deal because you have a shitload of options
Nate (2013-10-02 12:10) (1x <3): I drink when I'm with women to try and get them drunk.  This is the first day this week I wasn't at least partially hung over when I woke up.
Nate (2013-10-02 12:10): @jimmy pretty much.  I also know I can get more options if I put even a little effort it.
Nate (2013-10-02 12:10): in
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:11) (2x <3): Word on the street is that you're the best streetgamer these days
Xander (2013-10-02 12:12): Someone claimed that SRU was a street/day game god, but he's so elusive that I have yet to see him in action. Is that rumor true>
Xander (2013-10-02 12:12): ?
Nate (2013-10-02 12:12) (1x <3): I dunno if I'm the best.  I can get numbers really easy now, not sure how good that makes me.
Xander (2013-10-02 12:13) (1x <3): You seem very natural out in the field, like you're just having fun and inviting women into your joyous bubble
Nate (2013-10-02 12:14): Yeah, I just have fun now doing it.  My long conversation skills and text game still hold me back, but my numbers are making up for it.
Xander (2013-10-02 12:16): @Phil How about that little ginger troglodyte from last night? Disgustingly abrasive
Nate (2013-10-02 12:16): lol
Phil (2013-10-02 12:16): Oh god
Phil (2013-10-02 12:16): Most annoying convo ever
Xander (2013-10-02 12:17): I like how she stayed out there to continue talking to us, even though she kept telling us what worthless scum we were
Xander (2013-10-02 12:18): She couldn't bear to tear herself away from us attractive mofos
Xander (2013-10-02 12:18) (2x <3): And then she tried to follow me to the bathroom as well when I went inside...
Mark (2013-10-02 12:19) (1x <3): did you tap it?
Xander (2013-10-02 12:20) (1x <3): I don't hate myself THAT much
Phil (2013-10-02 12:20) (1x <3): She was gross and had nasty titties
Xander (2013-10-02 12:20): Her face looked like... a witch's
Xander (2013-10-02 12:21): I keep opening sets of girls that can't understand a word that I say because they don't speak English, but I wandered over to them in the first place because I got an IOI
Xander (2013-10-02 12:22) (1x <3): It's like, if you can't even speak to me, don't fucking give me bedroom eyes
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:22) (2x <3): http://www.flamewarriorsguide.com/Assets/troglodyte.jpg
Mark (2013-10-02 12:23) (1x <3): @Xander language barrier is a good excuse to get closer/more physical
Nate (2013-10-02 12:23) (1x <3): Sounds like she's just angry because she hates everything about her life
Xander (2013-10-02 12:24): @Mark That's true. I have been doing that when possible, but sometimes it isn't feasible
Mark (2013-10-02 12:27) (1x <3): anyone know of a place that teaches you how to do a british accent?
Mark (2013-10-02 12:27) (1x <3): shit is gold
Mark (2013-10-02 12:28): hell, if a girl has a nice british accent, even i get weak at the knees
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:30) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d6fcdd500dad013100c902795c29aa51
Mark (2013-10-02 12:30) (1x <3): LOL
Mark (2013-10-02 12:31) (1x <3): sandeep is the reason why i havent left the group yet
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:32) (1x <3): He and contro are amazing
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:32) (1x <3): I really want to see those two, and Nilay, in action, winging each other
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:32) (1x <3): Like I would pay money to see it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:33) (1x <3): But sandeep and contro are both pretty nice, can't hate too much on them
Mark (2013-10-02 12:33): its nothing personal
Mark (2013-10-02 12:33) (1x <3): they are just hilarious in their interpretation of game
Mark (2013-10-02 12:34) (1x <3): and its not like we havent tried to help
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:35) (2x <3): One of my favorite sandeep moments was when GOL posted some pretty funny sexualy text exchange he had.  Sandeep responds "OMG Gol I want to be like that!  And I want a girl like that!"
Xander (2013-10-02 12:36): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English
Mark (2013-10-02 12:37): im looking at dialect coaches in the city
Mark (2013-10-02 12:37): totally gonna do this
Xander (2013-10-02 12:37): @Mark check that out to get started. Figure out what dialect you want to learn
Phil (2013-10-02 12:37) (3x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/e801aa700dae0131fc27229de8656098
Phil (2013-10-02 12:37) (1x <3): This is how me and Nilay talk
Phil (2013-10-02 12:38): Lol
Mark (2013-10-02 12:38): omg
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:38) (3x <3): http://i.imgur.com/tTis1Pb.png
Mark (2013-10-02 12:39): dude Phil, i think hes into you
Phil (2013-10-02 12:39): Lmao omg jimmy
Mark (2013-10-02 12:41): that dog looks like it wants to be somewhere else
Nate (2013-10-02 12:42): I was torn tring to give Nilay day game advice.  I didn't wanna destroy what he was doing, and at the same time there were soo many things he was doing wrong.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:43): Nilay was a bit of a douchebag when I met him
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:43) (1x <3): At least sandeep and contro are nice kids
Xander (2013-10-02 12:43) (2x <3): I didn't absolutely hate running day game with Nilay the other day. I realized that no matter what I did, it couldn't be worse than what he was doing
Nate (2013-10-02 12:44): I didn't think he was a douche, I think he was just so awkward it came off like that.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:45): Nate were u there for the nightgame seminar?  W/ Ben & Charlie?
Nate (2013-10-02 12:45): Nope
Nate (2013-10-02 12:45): Oh wait yes
Nate (2013-10-02 12:45): Wait no that was a daygame seminar
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:46): They were talking about different nightclubs, and Nilay casually drops in "Oh yeah I like 1Oak, sometimes I'll drop in for a drink"
Xander (2013-10-02 12:47): Lol, like it's a dive bar
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 12:47) (3x <3): Then in the middle of the seminar he says "Hey I gotta leave now, have a date waiting for me!" - gets up, and runs straight into the glass door
Nate (2013-10-02 12:48): lol
Nate (2013-10-02 13:23) (3x <3): Me: You look like you could be interesting.  Her: I am interesting. Me: How? Her: I like interesting things. Me: Such as... Her: I don't know.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:24) (1x <3): "Charming"
Mark (2013-10-02 13:29): @Nate i like that "you look like you could be interesting" line
Mark (2013-10-02 13:29): did you open with that?
Nate (2013-10-02 13:30): Yeah, we were waiting on line for a sandwich
Xander (2013-10-02 13:34) (2x <3): Most girls have zero game these days
Mark (2013-10-02 13:36): i used to mistake their clumsiness with lack of interest
Mark (2013-10-02 13:36) (1x <3): now i know better
Xander (2013-10-02 13:47): Does anyone know if David Tong's game is decent?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:48): I've seen him.  I think he's decent
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:48): Gets results
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:48): And is a classy guy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:48): I'd nominate him for Closer
Xander (2013-10-02 13:50): Hmm, I feel like he has trouble staying in set, if I'm remembering correctly
Xander (2013-10-02 13:51): He just kinda lets them fizzle out
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:54): He def has some sticking points, as I'm sure we all do
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:55): That night at Solas, he was able to close well, and got to day3 w/ his chick
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:56): Whatever he's doing seems to be working for him
Mark (2013-10-02 13:57): whos david tong
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:59): Think I told u bout him
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:59): David Midtown
Mark (2013-10-02 13:59): ic
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 13:59): Kinda similar impression to yours
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:01) (2x <3): Anyway, the way I see Closers is, maybe not MPUAs by any stretch, but just socially congruent guys that I wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen around lol
Xander (2013-10-02 14:01): Good call
Xander (2013-10-02 14:01): Yeah, I wouldn't mind having him in here either
Mark (2013-10-02 14:01) (2x <3): so are we meeting up this week
Mark (2013-10-02 14:02) (2x <3): can be for just a quick drink, doesnt have to be an all night thing
Xander (2013-10-02 14:02): All night rager
Mark (2013-10-02 14:03) (2x <3): tbh nightgame lately has been more about having fun with my mates
Mark (2013-10-02 14:03) (2x <3): day stuff is way better for meeting girls
Mark (2013-10-02 14:03) (1x <3): you dont have that im a 9 in the club and a 6 on the street syndrome
Xander (2013-10-02 14:05): Seriously. As Phil said last night, we could be closing 9s in the street that would never give us the time of day in a night venue
Xander (2013-10-02 14:05): Everyone's an alpha when they're drunk
Mark (2013-10-02 14:06) (1x <3): most 9s dont even go to clubs because their social circle is rich enough where they dont have to seek marginal value at a chode fest
Nate (2013-10-02 14:09): Most of them are also never single
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:09): When ru dudes free for a brofest
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:11): I'm actually free all week
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:11): Late Fri night I will need to go to meatpacking
Mark (2013-10-02 14:12): im down for happy hour
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:13) (1x <3): Lots of 9s go to high end venues where they'll be bought drinks and get hit on all night, get some validation/ego inflation, then go home to their vibrator
Xander (2013-10-02 14:16): This hot Indian girl from Dubai was practically speechless last night when I told her that I don't buy girls drinks
Xander (2013-10-02 14:17): I'm booked up the rest of this week through Friday
Xander (2013-10-02 14:18): She was like, "But girls won't like you"
Xander (2013-10-02 14:18): Then I told her that I had already gotten numbers that night and her jaw kind of dropped
Xander (2013-10-02 14:19): I mean... wtf. Does she think this is the 1950s?
Mark (2013-10-02 14:19): i usually say "you get the first round, ill get the second"
Mark (2013-10-02 14:20): its a good middle ground
Mark (2013-10-02 14:20) (1x <3): but yeah, i never pay for a drink without strings attached
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:31) (1x <3): Next time a chick asks me to buy her a drink, how bout this: just laugh at her in her face
Xander (2013-10-02 14:31): That's one of my favorite maneuvers
Xander (2013-10-02 14:33): I key that can open many locks is a master key, but a lock that opens for many keys is a shitty lock.
Xander (2013-10-02 14:33): *A key
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:41): Friday: day game right after work midtown and grand Central
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:41): Then pop into a car for happy hour
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:41): Uh bar
Xander (2013-10-02 14:42): Hmm, sounds good to me
Xander (2013-10-02 14:42): I'll just push my Friday date later
Xander (2013-10-02 14:44): And if the bitch don't like it... TOO BAD
Nate (2013-10-02 14:45) (2x <3): @Xander do you think a first text to send to a girl who gave me her number after telling me she's sorta seeing someone is "Welcome to my friendzone."?
Xander (2013-10-02 14:45): I think that's hilarious!
Nate (2013-10-02 14:46): cool.  I already sent her a text with my name, so I guess I should wait till tomorrow for that...
Phil (2013-10-02 14:52): @jimmy I did exactly that at Solas the other day. Nobody ever asked me to buy them a drink before
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:53) (1x <3): So anybody else down for a little gaming + beers early Friday?
Phil (2013-10-02 14:54): so I kinda blew off marcelle and she might not be coming here anymore
Phil (2013-10-02 14:54): so if she doesn't then yeah
Nate (2013-10-02 14:55): Right now I'm open friday
Phil (2013-10-02 14:55) (1x <3): I might want to meet this girl Ali later cause she's a guaranteed lay basically
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 14:56) (1x <3): I'll tell David Tong to come out too, should be fun
Phil (2013-10-02 14:57): yea tong seems pretty cool I don't know him well enough yet
Xander (2013-10-02 15:13) (1x <3): I'll invite him to the group
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-02 15:15) (2x <3): Xander added Hot Tongs to the group
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:16): Booyah grandma
Hot Tongs (2013-10-02 15:39) (1x <3): ABC, always be closing!
Hot Tongs (2013-10-02 15:39) (2x <3): Id be down for Friday, was going to meet a girl but I can bump her
Phil (2013-10-02 15:43): Yo tong man in the house
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:49): Hey guys
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:49): What's that taxi app
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:50): Car service
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:50): Comes to u within 10 min
Mark (2013-10-02 15:52): uber
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 15:53): Anybody use it?
Nate (2013-10-02 15:54): We should make a list of the best apps
Nate (2013-10-02 15:56): That app asks for some crazy permissions: "Take pictures and videos", "Directly call phone numbers"
Nate (2013-10-02 16:01): FYI for android users I highly recommend this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pikanji.recentlyaddedcontacts
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:02): Hey Nate, I have that app, was thinking about writing my own version
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:02): That gives you the date + time the contact was added
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:02): Simple enough, I'm surprised they didn't do that
Nate (2013-10-02 16:02): Yeah, they probably wrote that in 10 mins tho
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:03): Would be pretty cool if it also geo-tagged where you added the contact too
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:03): But that might be a pretty expensive operation for simply adding a contact
Nate (2013-10-02 16:03): Oh definitely.  Would also be nice if it could tell me the last time I contacted them
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:04): That's a stupid thing about Android...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:04): W/ my old BB, if I viewed a contact, at the bottom was a summary of my last phone call(s), text/email exchange w/ that person
Nate (2013-10-02 16:07): The worst feature android has is when you put in names if your not really careful it will suggest people with the same name and if you hit them it will add the number to that contact instead.  Both parts of that are shit.
Nate (2013-10-02 16:10): Try putting Jen or Kate into my phone and it'll give like 5 or 6 suggestions now.
Nate (2013-10-02 16:10): Irritating
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:11): Esp. when it's Jen or Kate putting their info in your phone!!
Nate (2013-10-02 16:11): Yep, that's when it usually happens
Nate (2013-10-02 16:12): Even better when my fucking phone autocorrects their name to someone else when they hit space...
Xander (2013-10-02 16:13): Do they have Lyft out here or is that still only in SF?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:15): Not yet
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:16) (1x <3): NYC is the most difficult area to crack because of the TLC
Xander (2013-10-02 16:19) (1x <3): I remember picking up my Lyft driver in SF and having an awkward foursome once her shift was over
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:38): 2 Hour Open bar tonight
Xander (2013-10-02 16:38): Where
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:38): http://www.suite36nyc.com/uploads/thb/a7509b727ac8ac0aa47180fa9fe1def6.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:38): 9 pm
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:38): Grand Opening event
Xander (2013-10-02 16:38): I'll probably still be busy with my mini golf date, but we'll see
Xander (2013-10-02 16:39): Mini golf game = mark of an mpua
Mark (2013-10-02 16:54): are you going, jimbo?
Nate (2013-10-02 16:55): If a girl sends a long text explaining why she has to flake this week (some bs about not being productive).  Can I try to reschedule for early next week, or you think I should wait till the weekend?
Nate (2013-10-02 16:55): I already knew she was gonna flake because she said she might for a totally different reason earlier in the week
Nate (2013-10-02 16:56) (1x <3): Actually forgot I was going out with her by now
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:56): Me prob not. Gonna go out and sarge tmrw night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 16:57) (1x <3): I do need to start hitting on girls hard, pipeline is getting slim lately
Xander (2013-10-02 17:01) (1x <3): @Jimmyayo Want some of my leads? I'm losing track of em all and there are only so many days in the week
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 17:21): That takes the fun out of it though
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 17:24): "lays are the product of momentum, not one-shot deals. It’s similar to surfing. A surfer waits for hours for that nice wave, resigned every now and then to catch a dud. But he definitely doesn’t enter the water and catch a big one right away. If he wants to catch ten good waves he allots several hours in the water. 
If you want to bang one quality girl, you must approach a ton of girls."
Nate (2013-10-02 17:27) (1x <3): What if I wanna bang lots of mediocre girls?
Mark (2013-10-02 17:27): agreed. game is a process with each step as important as the last
Nate (2013-10-02 17:30): To become a master at any skill requires roughly 10,000 hours of practice.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 17:34): I need more macro momentum
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 17:34): Need to go out more...
Nate (2013-10-02 17:36) (1x <3): Day game can be done when your doing practically anything else
Xander (2013-10-02 17:53): @Jimmyayo You need to start going out as much as I do
Xander (2013-10-02 17:54) (1x <3): I have basically gone out in one form or another for almost every day of the past three weeks
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:09): I do daygame almost every day
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:09) (1x <3): Thing is, I have 2 consistent girls I can have sex with at almost any time, both with banging bodies.  It's giving me severe approach apathy, and it's unhealthy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:14): Need more motivationnnn
Nate (2013-10-02 18:16) (1x <3): @jimmy https://www.google.com/search?q=hot+girls&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=JZtMUtmaAYaCyAH2nYCYCQ&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=955&dpr=1
Phil (2013-10-02 18:16): hahaha ^
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:17): Argh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:17) (1x <3): Who wants to go out tonight??
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:17) (1x <3): Let's hit up that stupid open bar thing
Xander (2013-10-02 18:42): Maybe I'll just cancel my date
Xander (2013-10-02 18:42) (1x <3): Since that sounds like more fun than wrangling an awkward, painfully shy azn into bed
Xander (2013-10-02 18:44): She doesn't even know how to kiss properly...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:44): Huh wait...oh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:44): Haha was beginning to wonder if I was said asian
Xander (2013-10-02 18:44): No, not you,  Jimmyayo
Nate (2013-10-02 18:44) (1x <3): Jimmy, your a great kisser.  You know how to use your tongue.
Xander (2013-10-02 18:44) (1x <3): You know your way around a COCK
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:45): Nate watcha doin later
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:45): Let's hit up the bar. Its close to u
Xander (2013-10-02 18:45) (2x <3): I want a girl to take a shit on my arm
Nate (2013-10-02 18:45) (1x <3): Well in like a moment I'm going to a date, when it's done I'll text ya.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:45): And there's a new rooftop lounge right by there that we can bounce chicks to
Nate (2013-10-02 18:46): Sweet
Nate (2013-10-02 18:46) (1x <3): My rooftop is pretty nice too
Nate (2013-10-02 18:48): What's the bar?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:53): Suite 36
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 18:53): 36th b/t 5/6
Xander (2013-10-02 18:55): I'll let you know if my date falls through. She might be trying to flake because she's intimidated by my unrepentant masculinity
Xander (2013-10-02 19:03) (1x <3): Chicks who are scared of intimacy annoy me
Xander (2013-10-02 20:17): I flaked on my date
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 20:56): Will be at the open bar around 9:30
Jimmyayo (2013-10-02 21:37): Holy shitcakes its a fiasco! Leaving to another bar
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 01:32) (2x <3): Was a mini Closers meetup tonight lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 01:32): Good seeing everyone
Phil (2013-10-03 01:38) (1x <3): Ugh Wednesday night is not so great
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 01:51): Sorry bro :(
Xander (2013-10-03 01:52): Meh
Xander (2013-10-03 01:52): I dunno about classy establishments for me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 01:53) (2x <3): Maybe u prefer 13th step type of spots?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 01:55) (1x <3): Xandy did u finally go home?
Xander (2013-10-03 02:06) (1x <3): Just left Phil's and a walking to the PATH lol
Phil (2013-10-03 02:07) (1x <3): It's cool I would have liked 230 5th more if there were more people
Xander (2013-10-03 02:08): I'm gonna go for a PATH number close again
Phil (2013-10-03 02:09) (1x <3): Just got 2 more tinder matches
Phil (2013-10-03 02:09) (1x <3): Easyyy modeeee
Phil (2013-10-03 02:10) (1x <3): Make that 3
Xander (2013-10-03 02:15) (1x <3): Do you want me to text them for you again?
Phil (2013-10-03 02:18): Lol
Xander (2013-10-03 02:20): Then I just started banging my patients!
Xander (2013-10-03 02:21): Well, the courts took it really seriously, because I was doctor James Sears, "hugger", and they charged me with sexual harassment
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:25) (1x <3): Morning closers
Nate (2013-10-03 09:28): Morning Jimmy
Xander (2013-10-03 09:30): Today is a beautiful day! God is good!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:31): Nate, how'd your date go?
Xander (2013-10-03 09:32) (1x <3): Finger blasted her under the table, no doubt
Phil (2013-10-03 09:33): hey guys
Nate (2013-10-03 09:34): @Jimmy It was half a date and half a reunion.  This was a girl who friendzoned me years ago.  We didn't have sex because she said she was still dating the guy after me, however I said break up with your boyfriend then, and she basically said okay and talked about us hanging out again....
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:34): Ah, gotcha
Nate (2013-10-03 09:35) (1x <3): Unlike last time where I was a desperate loser, this time I was constantly teasing her, and she was complimenting me on my look, style, making references to my penis, eye fucking me.
Phil (2013-10-03 09:36): so any touching?
Phil (2013-10-03 09:36): kissing?
Nate (2013-10-03 09:36): Went to Solas, and it was mostly empty and I pulled her up to dance.
Nate (2013-10-03 09:36): Tons of touching, a bit of kissing.
Phil (2013-10-03 09:36): nice
Phil (2013-10-03 09:36): okay you rocked her fucking world
Nate (2013-10-03 09:36): Pretty much.
Phil (2013-10-03 09:37): I got this OKC message last night
Phil (2013-10-03 09:37) (2x <3): Try brunch at char no. 4; I've found that its almost as good as buying all of the things for brunch + Bloody Mary's and slowly consuming them in a robe as you lazily spend a Sunday having sex.
Phil (2013-10-03 09:38): I say in my pro that I'm always looking for good brunch places
Nate (2013-10-03 09:40): Considering the guy she's with was her first serious boyfriend that she said she loved, I'm not totally surprised she didn't sleep with me the first time we saw each other in 3 years.  I think it was a victory that she basically was fine with me saying okay break up with him.
Nate (2013-10-03 09:40): mmm brunch
Nate (2013-10-03 09:41): I know it's not an mpua victory tho :)
Nate (2013-10-03 09:41): How was the bars last night?
Phil (2013-10-03 09:42) (1x <3): just okay I # closed a 30 asian with braces
Phil (2013-10-03 09:42): 30 y/o*
Phil (2013-10-03 09:42): lol
Nate (2013-10-03 09:43): strong number?
Phil (2013-10-03 09:43) (1x <3): I think so actually
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:43): The nurse friend?
Phil (2013-10-03 09:43): um
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:43): Irene
Phil (2013-10-03 09:43): nope
Phil (2013-10-03 09:43): Jee sun
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:44): Ah the 3rd one
Phil (2013-10-03 09:44): ya
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:44): She seemed very receptive
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:44): She and my chick both were
Phil (2013-10-03 09:44): yeah she totally was
Nate (2013-10-03 09:45): cool
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:50) (1x <3): I got a #close and nice  makeout
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:50) (1x <3): A little unfair, it kinda fell in my lap
Phil (2013-10-03 09:51): nahh ^
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:52) (3x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0730a3900e610131c1142aaf897b8632
Nate (2013-10-03 09:52): All out of dates this week, time to get new #'s and such
Phil (2013-10-03 09:53): that's pretty adorable jimmy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:53) (1x <3): But last night was good, got me in an approaching state of mind again
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:55): Was really funny to see those other puas
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 09:55): And we basically stole their set
Phil (2013-10-03 09:56): oh yeahhh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:02): I turned to the chick and whispered "do u need me to save u?"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:03) (1x <3): And she said "save me" loud enough for the drunk pua to hear
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:21) (2x <3): It's great having wingmen at night for getting in state
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:21): After going solo for so long, or being surrounded by the likes of contro et al, it's refreshing
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:22): In my year of being in pickup, finally have some decent guys that know how to hang out and not be awkward about talking to people at a bar
Nate (2013-10-03 10:23): @jimmy you up for some after work action today?
Xander (2013-10-03 10:24) (2x <3): @Phil practically forced me to number close the less attractive friend, who we ran into on the street
Xander (2013-10-03 10:25) (1x <3): @Jimmyayo Man, that group of three guys really sucked at talking to girls
Xander (2013-10-03 10:25): They were cPUAs
Xander (2013-10-03 10:25): "c" is for "chump"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:26): @nate yeah, for a little bit. Got some errands to run later
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:26): Xander that was a great observation u made last night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:26) (2x <3): About my energy flowing into my text game
Nate (2013-10-03 10:28) (2x <3): Xander = Yoda?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:29) (1x <3): Basically, if Yoda was a redpill pushing asshole surrounded by pussy
Xander (2013-10-03 10:29): Hahaha
Phil (2013-10-03 10:29): wasn't he?
Phil (2013-10-03 10:29) (1x <3): probably when he was like only 200 y/o
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:30): Those three were bad, in that they tried to divide + conquer way to early
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:31): The girls just got to the bar, and boom the 3 puas separated/isolated the 3 girls almost immediately
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:31): Making the girls feel very uncomfortable
Xander (2013-10-03 10:31): Yeah, they weren't making things fun at all. It was all very obviously slimy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:32): I'm trying to remember the shit that tall blonde guy was saying...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:32): I remember it was super cheesy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:32) (1x <3): And he was pretty inebriated
Xander (2013-10-03 10:32): I didn't overhear much of it, but his body language was shite
Phil (2013-10-03 10:33) (1x <3): he looked pretty try hard
Xander (2013-10-03 10:33): One of my favorite terms
Xander (2013-10-03 10:33): Just some try-hard rando
Phil (2013-10-03 10:35): this is how I game http://youtu.be/826HMLoiE_o
Phil (2013-10-03 10:36): keep going until the girl is exhausted then I make the kill
Xander (2013-10-03 10:38) (1x <3): Ugh, I have to go to Williamsburg to eat a taco tonight
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:38) (1x <3): So next Wednesday, we'll go hit up some NYU bars, yeah?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:38): Is that a metaphor?
Xander (2013-10-03 10:38) (1x <3): It's certainly a double entedre
Xander (2013-10-03 10:39): I'ma get a taco with girl at La Superior, then I'ma eat her taco
Nate (2013-10-03 10:39) (1x <3): Triple, there will be an actual taco involved
Nate (2013-10-03 10:39) (2x <3): Damn too slow
Xander (2013-10-03 10:40) (1x <3): I'm a little scared. We have one friend in common on Tinder
Nate (2013-10-03 10:40): Ahh, so dude
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:40): Nais ::)
Xander (2013-10-03 10:40): Want to see a redpill kiss close? http://youtu.be/nTomKxvEVz0
Xander (2013-10-03 10:45): It's uncomfortable to watch at certain moments, but he clearly DGAF
Phil (2013-10-03 10:46) (1x <3): haha that's pretty similar to how I game
Xander (2013-10-03 10:46): Yeah. me too, haha
Xander (2013-10-03 10:47): All the leaning in and touching
Xander (2013-10-03 10:47): Then you're finally just like, "COME HERE"
Phil (2013-10-03 10:47) (1x <3): that girl has such a nice ass
Xander (2013-10-03 10:49): 10/10, Would Ogle Again
Mark (2013-10-03 10:50): top o the morning
Mark (2013-10-03 10:50): how was the crowd at 230 5th last night?
Xander (2013-10-03 10:51): http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/238/656/0f9.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:52) (2x <3): Not much talent.  Though there was a 3-set of girls that we should've approached but didn't
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:52) (1x <3): And a 6-set of girls that had very closed body positioning
Xander (2013-10-03 10:52): @Phil and I saw a group of three super-betas
Xander (2013-10-03 10:53): Rich middle aged dudes buying golddigger girls drinks
Mark (2013-10-03 10:53): still the same b&t crowd?
Mark (2013-10-03 10:53): or is it better than fri/sat
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:53): Lol it's completely diff, just very quiet/chill
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:54): I opened 2 swiss girls, I'd say both were 6's
Xander (2013-10-03 10:54) (3x <3): Nah, the older chick was like an age-adjusted 9
Xander (2013-10-03 10:54) (1x <3): LOL
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:54) (1x <3): Pretty easy to open, they were peacocking w/ their dirndles
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:55): Oh right, forgot about age-inflation-rate
Xander (2013-10-03 10:55): I couldn't believe how good she looked for her age. 37!? I thought she was 23!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 10:55) (2x <3): I thought about making out w/ the younger one...but regina was watching the whole entire thing
Nate (2013-10-03 10:56) (1x <3): I realized I'm an idiot. I should have friendzoned this other jap girl instead of telling her to get lost.  Gonna wait till next week and change that so I can hook up with her friends.
Mark (2013-10-03 10:58): what happened to the open bar thing? too crowded?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:01) (2x <3): Yah it was super crowded...and the crowd was......urban
Xander (2013-10-03 11:01): You shoulda brought your bling
Phil (2013-10-03 11:01) (1x <3): hee... hee... urban
Mark (2013-10-03 11:02) (3x <3): +1 for political correctness
Xander (2013-10-03 11:02): @Phil LOL Dana from 13th Step, Tues just messaged me back
Xander (2013-10-03 11:04) (2x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f74602400e6a01317c7206e00e08d7be
Phil (2013-10-03 11:04): damn she's got some wits about her
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:07): There's this chick Cate Jones, we went on 1 date at a loud ass club about 3 weeks ago.  Her texts are usually very non-committed, so I started texting her sparsely
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:07): Then, this am:
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:08) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8dca9bc00e6b0131db725eee69339f4f

Xander (2013-10-03 11:10): True
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:10): What's a good response?
Xander (2013-10-03 11:11): "What's in it for me?"
Xander (2013-10-03 11:11): lol, that's bad
Xander (2013-10-03 11:11) (1x <3): That's my line for when a girl asks me to buy her a drink
Mark (2013-10-03 11:11) (1x <3): "only if you promise i wont catch whatever it is you have"
Xander (2013-10-03 11:15): That's decent. Roll with that
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:15): "Wtf ru serious"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:15): Haha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:15): Too assholey
Xander (2013-10-03 11:15) (1x <3): "I don't wanna get you pregnant"
Xander (2013-10-03 11:16): "Are you auditioning for a soap opera"
Xander (2013-10-03 11:16) (1x <3): Oh man... gotta love Chateau Heartiste

Xander (2013-10-03 11:20): At least those azns we were talking to had good English
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:20) (2x <3): http://i.qkme.me/3pjdxr.jpg
Xander (2013-10-03 11:21): Maybe if you spent a little less time saying your goo-goo gah-gah talk and a little more time learning how to speak AMERICAN
Mark (2013-10-03 11:21) (2x <3): *murican

Phil (2013-10-03 11:24): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:24): =( I know what "pretty good means" ass
Xander (2013-10-03 11:24) (2x <3): http://www.rooshvforum.com/attachment.php?aid=14645
Phil (2013-10-03 11:24): you heard about the gov't shut down. that's messed up right
Phil (2013-10-03 11:25): gus ^
Phil (2013-10-03 11:25): oh damn there it is
Phil (2013-10-03 11:25) (2x <3): btw what the motherfucking fuck
Phil (2013-10-03 11:25) (2x <3): "hiiii
I was just thinking
it's so nice that I met you
I am so glad about that
you made me think that I need to spread my wings"
Phil (2013-10-03 11:25): -gorgeous dutch girl
Mark (2013-10-03 11:25) (3x <3): she needs to spread something alright
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:26): http://replygif.net/i/154.gif
Xander (2013-10-03 11:31): So, I have a dilemma
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:31): What did u fellas think of wally?
Xander (2013-10-03 11:31): Seems like a cool dude
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:31): Skinny black dude
Xander (2013-10-03 11:31) (1x <3): But I have a feeling that he's going to disappear after a few weeks
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:32) (1x <3): Same feeling
Phil (2013-10-03 11:32) (1x <3): he needs to unbutton some of his buttons
Phil (2013-10-03 11:32): that's what I think
Nate (2013-10-03 11:33) (1x <3): Show off the man bush.  Girls love to run their hands through my chest hair.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:33): Nice foxtail peacocking
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:34): He's a DJ, I can see him have some potential as long as he's socially aware
Xander (2013-10-03 11:34) (2x <3): I'm not trying to talk to a guy with a sea of chest hair
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:34): LOL
Xander (2013-10-03 11:34): So if you aren't buying me drinks, get lost!
Nate (2013-10-03 11:35) (2x <3): Don't lie Xander, you like running your hands through my chest hair too.
Nate (2013-10-03 11:36) (2x <3): Dammit I just watched that red pill kiss close video.  Now I have no blood to my brain.  So hard to work.
Phil (2013-10-03 11:36): oh man me too ^
Phil (2013-10-03 11:36) (1x <3): I got a huge hard on watching that
Nate (2013-10-03 11:36): Same
Xander (2013-10-03 11:37) (1x <3): If a girl doesn't like your chest hair, it's because she's secretly a fag-hag or she wants a weak, metrosexual man who she can easily dominate
Xander (2013-10-03 11:37): In other words, STAY AWAY
Nate (2013-10-03 11:39) (2x <3): I only started doing serious continuous teasing and not giving straight answers like a couple weeks ago.  I realized last night it was really clicking with me. So much fun.
Xander (2013-10-03 11:42): I give straight answers about 10% of the time
Nate (2013-10-03 11:43) (1x <3): I was always too afraid before to stick with total bullshit for more than a minute.  Last weekend I tried not giving a straight answer ever the whole night, and she was so into it.
Nate (2013-10-03 11:45) (1x <3): Last night I may not have fucked the girl, but it was so obvious how powerful this stuff is, especially when I get really good at it.
Nate (2013-10-03 11:46): She gave me so many compliments...
Xander (2013-10-03 11:49): @Nate I'm fuckin proud of you
Nate (2013-10-03 11:49): Thanks :)
Nate (2013-10-03 11:50) (1x <3): She bringing up my dick in conversation, except she was calling it 'hot stuff'
Nate (2013-10-03 11:50): kept
Xander (2013-10-03 11:55): Dude, I can't wait for my company to move back into an office space. We're working out of an apartment right now, and I'm so fucking sick of my boss's omega roommate shuffling around the house
Nate (2013-10-03 11:56): Omega as in super fat?
Mark (2013-10-03 11:57) (1x <3): omega as in brave new world
Xander (2013-10-03 11:57): Omega male. As in, the polar opposite of an alpha male
Xander (2013-10-03 11:57): He's a 37 year old virgin
Nate (2013-10-03 11:57): eww
Mark (2013-10-03 11:57) (2x <3): 3 more years and he'll get his own movie
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 11:57): http://replygif.net/i/169.gif
Xander (2013-10-03 11:58): No he won't, because I'm going to buy him a high-class escort before then
Xander (2013-10-03 11:58) (1x <3): And people say I have no heart...
Phil (2013-10-03 11:59) (1x <3): dude steven hawking is def alpha
Phil (2013-10-03 11:59) (1x <3): he knows he's the shit he can just destroy your mind without moving
Nate (2013-10-03 12:01) (2x <3): Steven hawking divorced his wife and married his nurse, while immobilized in a wheel chair.  He's a pimp.
Nate (2013-10-03 12:01) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/094b5bc00e730131bed3367e29ec5123
Xander (2013-10-03 12:02): Would Bang
Xander (2013-10-03 12:04): Alright, I just ordered a paperback version of The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi
Phil (2013-10-03 12:05): Xander can you send me the roosh day game thing
Xander (2013-10-03 12:05): I'm already very familiar with everything in it, but I want to see how good of a resource it is for other guys who are ready to unplug
Xander (2013-10-03 12:05): @Phil Sure thing
Nate (2013-10-03 12:05): Rollo Tomassi is the name from LA Confidential (great movie)
Xander (2013-10-03 12:06): Do you guys have dropbox?
Nate (2013-10-03 12:07): I do
Xander (2013-10-03 12:07): What about you Phil
Phil (2013-10-03 12:08): yeah
Phil (2013-10-03 12:08): philipleesha@gmail.com
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:08): Don't read daybang it sucks
Nate (2013-10-03 12:08): What about Bang?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:08): Better
Xander (2013-10-03 12:09): @Jimmyayo I disagree. I think it's worth reading along with other stuff
Xander (2013-10-03 12:09): Indirect game is perfect for lurking in bookstores/coffeeshops/Whole Foods
Xander (2013-10-03 12:09): But it is a little dated at this point
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:09) (1x <3): The framework is too complicated
Xander (2013-10-03 12:10): Oh, well, I wasn't expecting anyone in here to dogmatically follow the framework
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:10): Gets u in ur head too much imo
Xander (2013-10-03 12:10): It's more just the spirit of the book
Xander (2013-10-03 12:10): Give me your email, Nate
Nate (2013-10-03 12:10): Indirect only works well if everything else about you is congruent, otherwise she just thinks your casually talking to her
Mark (2013-10-03 12:10): can you add me as well: guymontag9@gmail.com
Nate (2013-10-03 12:10): @Xander for dropbox?
Xander (2013-10-03 12:11): Yes
Nate (2013-10-03 12:11): questnate@gmail.com
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:11) (1x <3): BTW I used marks text. ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/63ff94d00e74013165ba3e378bea7062
Nate (2013-10-03 12:11): That's my spammy email address
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:11): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/68d119700e740131c1142aaf897b8632
Xander (2013-10-03 12:11): This folder is kinda random, but it has some of the shit in it that Phil wanted
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:11): Too assholey?
Xander (2013-10-03 12:12): Nah
Nate (2013-10-03 12:12): @xander you also have my personal email too :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:12) (2x <3): Well obviously xander you won't think so
Xander (2013-10-03 12:12): Not even "should", just command it
Xander (2013-10-03 12:12) (1x <3): If ur not working, bring me coffee w/ all that free time
Mark (2013-10-03 12:13) (1x <3): after she said "haha ur so selfish", you couldve responded with "im very giving in the right setting ;)"
Xander (2013-10-03 12:13): Meh, I don't think so
Xander (2013-10-03 12:14): I like the ignoring it and talking about whatever he feels like response
Mark (2013-10-03 12:14) (1x <3): you could, but seems like a wasted conversational thread to me
Xander (2013-10-03 12:14): Did that link work for everyone?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:15) (1x <3): Yah i like that Mark.  Gotta mix in some pull/innuendo
Mark (2013-10-03 12:16): i got it, <3 xander
Nate (2013-10-03 12:16): Didn't work for me
Xander (2013-10-03 12:18): Hmm, I just rearranged the contents a bunch, too
Mark (2013-10-03 12:19): did you delete the folder? cant find it now
Xander (2013-10-03 12:19): Alright, I'ma link you guys again...
Phil (2013-10-03 12:19) (1x <3): @Xander my "tell me something you think is important" message got a two long paragraph response
Phil (2013-10-03 12:20): that's why I like it
Phil (2013-10-03 12:20): @mark yeah me too but I downloaded it already
Xander (2013-10-03 12:20): Did you want the link too, Jimmy?

Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:22): jimboyoo@gmail.com
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 12:22): Yes please!
Xander (2013-10-03 12:23): Alright, I have more books stored somewhere, but I'll have to track em down
Mark (2013-10-03 12:24) (1x <3): thanks dude
Xander (2013-10-03 12:24): Can everyone access the two subfolders in that link?
Nate (2013-10-03 12:25) (1x <3): Thanks Xander
Nate (2013-10-03 12:25) (1x <3): Yes
Phil (2013-10-03 12:25): yea
Xander (2013-10-03 12:25): It's kind of a random sampling of red pill game/theory books
Xander (2013-10-03 12:26): Anatomy of Female Power is some crazy shit...
Xander (2013-10-03 12:28): I'm hoping that The Rational Male book will turn out to be an instant classic
Xander (2013-10-03 12:29): I want to have something that I can gift to friends who need that shit
Xander (2013-10-03 12:29): Since it's only $10 too
Xander (2013-10-03 12:33): Oh my god, dude... https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/q71/1375143_10151776488597740_232834781_n.jpg
Xander (2013-10-03 12:33): contro just posted that on his facebook
Phil (2013-10-03 12:34): I don't get it
Xander (2013-10-03 12:34): I don't either, it's just racist as shit
Xander (2013-10-03 12:34): looool
Phil (2013-10-03 12:34): oh hahah
Phil (2013-10-03 12:34): I thought I was missing something
Phil (2013-10-03 12:35) (1x <3): damn I got some hot tinder matches yesterday
Phil (2013-10-03 12:35): just got one this morning too
Xander (2013-10-03 12:43): I got one walking to the PATH last night
Xander (2013-10-03 12:44) (1x <3): I'm gonna have to get my sales funnel going with those matches you helped me select, @Phil
Xander (2013-10-03 12:49) (1x <3): I think you're right, that it might actually be too many girls for me to handle.
Xander (2013-10-03 12:49): There aren't enough hours in the day
Phil (2013-10-03 12:50) (1x <3): hahah pretty soon I could get to that point
Xander (2013-10-03 14:33) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3ac956b00e880131291c1678590cd4d4

Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 14:50): Fashion mixer event
Mark (2013-10-03 14:57) (2x <3): just met with @Nate for lunch
Mark (2013-10-03 14:57) (3x <3): can confirm that he is not a hunchback leper
Xander (2013-10-03 14:57) (3x <3): He might have to start dressing that way soon to give himself a day game handicap
Xander (2013-10-03 15:00) (1x <3): @Nate It is in woman's nature to submit to a powerful man
Nate (2013-10-03 15:04): I did have some weak sets while I was with Mark :)
Nate (2013-10-03 15:10): @Xander Eye opened, I should think that way.
Xander (2013-10-03 15:15): Ugh, I'm so disgustingly fat. I need to go throw up my food NOW
Xander (2013-10-03 15:16): BLAAAAAARRRGGGHHH
Phil (2013-10-03 15:16) (1x <3): lets do some cross fit bro
Xander (2013-10-03 15:17): For sure, let's
Xander (2013-10-03 15:17): My crotch is really itching. I hope I didn't catch something
Phil (2013-10-03 15:17): uhhh
Nate (2013-10-03 15:20): Crossfit will get you into fantastic shape, until you have your inevitable injury
Xander (2013-10-03 15:22): I did it for a year straight back in the day
Nate (2013-10-03 15:23) (1x <3): I did it for 6 months until I had a major back injury cause the trainer told me to do something stupid and I listened.
Phil (2013-10-03 15:24): yikes
Nate (2013-10-03 15:24) (1x <3): You can thank her for 8 months of physical therapy
Xander (2013-10-03 15:27): What a FUCKING BITCH
Nate (2013-10-03 15:27): Ya
Xander (2013-10-03 15:27): I hope you raped her good and hard in retaliation
Nate (2013-10-03 15:27) (2x <3): Damn right

Xander (2013-10-03 15:33) (1x <3): Thank you @Jimmyayo for the fake glasses.
Xander (2013-10-03 15:34) (1x <3): Aaaaand I'm gonna add a period to the end of that sentence
Nate (2013-10-03 15:34): I'm totally gonna rip that off in every way but the glasses I don't have.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 15:35): Wait where is this
Nate (2013-10-03 15:35) (1x <3): The burrito place
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 15:35): Ah right
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 15:36) (2x <3): The night of the brorritos
Nate (2013-10-03 15:37) (2x <3): @Xander it's timex's head that brings the girls over the top wet. ;)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 15:38) (2x <3): Haha I was gonna say, this picture deserves a thought bubble...

"Hm, I wonder...why is Nick's head growing out of my hand?  Ah, life is such a mystery"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 15:39): So nobody wants to go to the fashion event tonight?
Xander (2013-10-03 15:39): I have a date in Willysburg at 8

Nate (2013-10-03 15:40) (1x <3): I can probably go, although I wanted to do day game.
Xander (2013-10-03 15:56): Worst blue pill story I have ever read: http://i.imgur.com/aUxujlg.jpg
Nate (2013-10-03 15:59) (1x <3): I couldn't stomach reading much of that

Nate (2013-10-03 16:13): If you wanna make sure she never contacts you again send her that
Phil (2013-10-03 16:19): jesus I can't believe he did all her work after she fucked him I would have been like oops your mistake bitch now get out of my house
Nate (2013-10-03 16:19): I skipped to the end after about 2 paragraphs and saw she fucked him out of disgust :)

Phil (2013-10-03 16:22): oh yeah that ^
Xander (2013-10-03 16:22) (2x <3): I cry after every time I have had sex, because I'm always giving it to someone less valuable than me
Xander (2013-10-03 16:22) (1x <3): It's lonely at the top
Phil (2013-10-03 16:22) (1x <3): lmfao okay I just cracked up at work

Nate (2013-10-03 17:49) (1x <3): Hahahhaah.  If you had to ask permission to do stuff the human race would die out because noone would ever get laid.
Xander (2013-10-03 17:50): I remember some other misguided cunt posting that same article like a year ago on FB
Phil (2013-10-03 17:51): I'm reading the misandry bubble

Xander (2013-10-03 18:29): Kids... don't try this at home.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 18:29) (1x <3): She has no idea what's in store for her
Phil (2013-10-03 19:05): Any of you guys have experience with Russian girls. What type of game should I run tonight
Phil (2013-10-03 19:05): Just curious as to what to expect
Xander (2013-10-03 19:07): She may be cold, like those hot bitches that Lumi tried to open on the street
Xander (2013-10-03 19:07) (2x <3): In that case, be a completely irreverent asshole
Phil (2013-10-03 19:07) (1x <3): Awesome I'm becoming semi pro at that
Xander (2013-10-03 19:10): Hmm... I might have just over-trolled my Friday date. I'm not sure
Xander (2013-10-03 19:11): If it says, "Message failed to deliver" does that mean that she blocked my number? Hahaha
Phil (2013-10-03 19:16): Lol shiiiitttttt
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 19:18) (2x <3): Eastern euros like their men pretty alpha
Xander (2013-10-03 19:25) (1x <3): Never mind, she came back for more Xander
Phil (2013-10-03 19:25): Cool
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 19:25): Like alpha but chivalrous
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 19:26): Dominant
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 19:26): But still a gentleman
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 19:26) (2x <3): "Men are the gas pedal women are brakes" applies even more so w/ them

Nate (2013-10-03 20:23): Oh misread that, feel free :)
Nate (2013-10-03 20:25): Whenever I'm having a slow game day, I just need to talk to a milf and I feel instantly awesome
Xander (2013-10-03 20:25): I'm officially past the saturation point. I can't keep track of everybody in my head, I need to get a rolodex
Nate (2013-10-03 20:36) (1x <3): I've decided that until I have a solid list of fuckbuddies, I'm gonna add older woman to each week.  I always get plenty of younger dates, but this guarantees I get laid each week.
Nate (2013-10-03 20:36): 1 older woman
Nate (2013-10-03 20:37) (1x <3): They are game on easy mode.  An hour or so of conversation and making out, and it's back to my place or theirs.
Nate (2013-10-03 20:38): It was a slow day.  Only got 2 numbers besides that one.  One has a serious bf so it'll be hard to make happen, and the other won't be back in the city for a month.
Nate (2013-10-03 20:40): I'll go out tomorrow night with you guys tho and see what else we can find :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-03 21:31): I told the girl from 230 5th last night to come meet me now

Nate (2013-10-04 10:33) (1x <3): This girl yesterday thought I was playing a prank during daygame. She didn't get comfortable with me until I started relentlessly making fun of her. Then she couldn't give me her number fast enough.
Xander (2013-10-04 10:37): Gooooood morning closers

Nate (2013-10-04 11:06): @Mark set up drinks for sunday night at solas.  If she says Yes I'll go an stop texting her on my phone :)
Mark (2013-10-04 11:07): oh man
Nate (2013-10-04 11:07): It would be really hard to find her tho since we don't know each other :)
Xander (2013-10-04 11:07): Somone needs to please poor Kitty Sun
Xander (2013-10-04 11:07) (2x <3): I'm not man enough to do it
Xander (2013-10-04 11:10) (1x <3): Man, SRU seems like he has some heavy shit weighing on his mind
Xander (2013-10-04 11:10) (1x <3): He didn't even talk about it, but you could just tell
Mark (2013-10-04 11:11): thought that guy was an approach machine
Mark (2013-10-04 11:11): but havent met him yet, so... idk
Phil (2013-10-04 11:11): he is that
Phil (2013-10-04 11:11): indeed
Phil (2013-10-04 11:12): and seems pretty natural at it
Mark (2013-10-04 11:12): this was on the street, yes?
Nate (2013-10-04 11:13): I've run into him more than once at union square
Xander (2013-10-04 11:13): SRU admitted to me that he doesn't even want to approach unless he thinks that the girl is possible marriage material...
Mark (2013-10-04 11:13): he's mid/late 30s im guessing?
Xander (2013-10-04 11:13): I basically told him that I thought that was a bad frame
Phil (2013-10-04 11:13): he's 32
Nate (2013-10-04 11:13): How the hell would you even know from the physical
Xander (2013-10-04 11:14): Oh, I think he said he was 33 now
Xander (2013-10-04 11:15): The ravages of time are taking their toll
Nate (2013-10-04 11:16): I think his problem is he has too much invested in the outcome and not enough on the journey
Xander (2013-10-04 11:16): It's about the conquest!
Nate (2013-10-04 11:16): The road is long, and if you're constantly staring at the end you'll walk off a cliff at the turn.
Nate (2013-10-04 11:17): </philosophy>
Nate (2013-10-04 11:18): I used to be like that, then I realized I'd actually like to enjoy myself too.

Phil (2013-10-04 11:22): hahaha
Mark (2013-10-04 11:29): are we still on for happy hour today, lads?
Phil (2013-10-04 11:29): I just got a date
Phil (2013-10-04 11:29): she texted me
Mark (2013-10-04 11:29): taco girl?
Phil (2013-10-04 11:29): nah different girl
Phil (2013-10-04 11:30) (1x <3): another tinder girl that Xander fucking owned with his sweet words
Phil (2013-10-04 11:30): for me
Phil (2013-10-04 11:30): but I'll still come and meet up with her with you guys
Mark (2013-10-04 11:31): yeah i have to be somewhere later tonight, but have time for a quick drink or two right after work
Mark (2013-10-04 11:31): phil where do you work btw

Mark (2013-10-04 11:33): im a few blocks away
Phil (2013-10-04 11:33): oh damn
Phil (2013-10-04 11:33): yeah lets do that
Xander (2013-10-04 11:33): Shiiiit, I don't think I can make happy hour
Xander (2013-10-04 11:36) (1x <3): I also think that Phil's shirt might have given me a flesh eating bacteria
Nate (2013-10-04 11:36) (1x <3): I'm suddenly wondering if I should sleep with a girl Xander has slept with...
Xander (2013-10-04 11:37): I haven't banged Kitty Sun. She gave me her number when I was out in Hoboken with a friend a month ago, before I started running game with you guys
Nate (2013-10-04 11:37): Ahh
Mark (2013-10-04 11:37): hey Nate, kitty wants to know if youre chinese
Mark (2013-10-04 11:37): what should i say
Nate (2013-10-04 11:38): Eskimo
Xander (2013-10-04 11:38): Favorite moment of last night's date: "I don't really believe in gay marriage." Her jaw drops. "I don't believe in straight marriage either."
Xander (2013-10-04 11:39): Seriously though, I have hives all over my body
Nate (2013-10-04 11:39): Sounds like an allergy
Mark (2013-10-04 11:41): sounds like herpes
Nate (2013-10-04 11:41) (1x <3): I guess I shouldn't text Kitty lol.  Mark is doing all the work for me.
Xander (2013-10-04 11:41) (2x <3): The mark of a true playa.
Nate (2013-10-04 11:41): Pun intended
Mark (2013-10-04 11:42): Nate, if i set up kitty for you, you have to make sure to bag her
Phil (2013-10-04 11:42): ughh contro
Mark (2013-10-04 11:42): even if she is a bush barry
Mark (2013-10-04 11:42): bushbaby*
Nate (2013-10-04 11:42): Omg contro's text post in the main chat is baaaad
Nate (2013-10-04 11:42): @Mark What if I think she's hideous or something?
Mark (2013-10-04 11:42): thats part of the deal
Mark (2013-10-04 11:43) (1x <3): borrow one of xander's brown paper bags
Mark (2013-10-04 11:43): idk
Nate (2013-10-04 11:43): Okay, but if she's fat I'm not doing it.
Xander (2013-10-04 11:43): @Nate She's skinny and tall, like my height.
Nate (2013-10-04 11:43) (2x <3): Then I'll bang her, for science
Xander (2013-10-04 11:43): But I think her face is fairly unremarkable, if I recall correctly
Nate (2013-10-04 11:44) (2x <3): I like legs, I'll take that
Xander (2013-10-04 11:44): Either way, she is really nice and obviously looking for a guy
Nate (2013-10-04 11:44): Yeah I think you're right Xander :)
Xander (2013-10-04 11:45): Like, I could dump our text conversation for you
Mark (2013-10-04 11:45): were doing her a massive service
Nate (2013-10-04 11:45) (2x <3): I saw parts of it.  It looks like contro's but from the other side.
Nate (2013-10-04 11:46): Mark you have to show me the rest of the chat log tho too.
Xander (2013-10-04 11:47): Yeah, I kept the conversation with her very beta because I wasn't actually interested
Mark (2013-10-04 11:48): Nate, will do
Nate (2013-10-04 11:48): Was she at least fun to talk to?
Mark (2013-10-04 11:49): like watching paint dry
Nate (2013-10-04 11:49): haha
Mark (2013-10-04 11:49): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/80413ac00f3a01316d3a1e6549d549e0
Mark (2013-10-04 11:50): thats the middle text... not a big talker, this one
Nate (2013-10-04 11:50) (1x <3): Just make sure this is for drinks.  If I don't like her I'm gonna want to get real drunk if I'm gonna take her home.
Mark (2013-10-04 11:52): will try my best
Mark (2013-10-04 11:52): shes a bit thickheaded tbh
Phil (2013-10-04 11:52): okay my dates for 9
Phil (2013-10-04 11:52): so I can meet before that
Nate (2013-10-04 11:52) (1x <3): I'm such a giver...
Nate (2013-10-04 11:53) (1x <3): Omg @contro
Mark (2013-10-04 11:53) (1x <3): so much cringe
Phil (2013-10-04 11:53): lol I know
Phil (2013-10-04 11:53) (1x <3): seriously its a shit show in that other chat today
Nate (2013-10-04 11:54) (3x <3): I feel like his text game used to be a lot better than this.  At least before he wasn't destroying himself.
Xander (2013-10-04 11:57): I can't bring myself to read anything in the other chat. Had to log out again
Nate (2013-10-04 11:57) (2x <3): Earlier I seriously had to stop because anything they said could only hurt me
Xander (2013-10-04 11:59): https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8sgBV4EIfFeVUdPekhpUDk4QlU/edit?usp=sharing
Nate (2013-10-04 12:00) (1x <3): Lol Xander not a fan of weed...
Xander (2013-10-04 12:02): I mean, I can't smoke it any more
Xander (2013-10-04 12:02) (1x <3): Can anyone tell how little I cared about that entire text conversation
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:05) (3x <3): Haha so the other chat is just sandeep, contro and ltd commiserating their sad lives
Nate (2013-10-04 12:06) (1x <3): It's amazing how pathetic it is without any of us participating.
Xander (2013-10-04 12:06): @Phil What did we do Wednesday night?
Phil (2013-10-04 12:07): lol 230 5th Xander
Xander (2013-10-04 12:07): Aw shit
Nate (2013-10-04 12:07) (1x <3): FYI for those of you pussying out on doing daygame.  You can meet girls like the one I met yesterday who works 12hr days and has no life, and a practically screaming to be fucked. :)
Phil (2013-10-04 12:08): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/20849da00f3d0131dfa34e25132ab9df
Phil (2013-10-04 12:08): does this mean she wants to fuck me
Phil (2013-10-04 12:08): lol
Nate (2013-10-04 12:09) (1x <3): Either that or she's fucking someone else before she meets up with you...
Phil (2013-10-04 12:09): that's cool
Phil (2013-10-04 12:10) (2x <3): that means she'll be ready
Xander (2013-10-04 12:12): Ow, my poop burns
Phil (2013-10-04 12:12): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b52fce400f3d01314d9802dfc179b44b

Phil (2013-10-04 12:12): that's jessie
Nate (2013-10-04 12:12) (2x <3): @Xander see a doctor
Xander (2013-10-04 12:13): It's because I eat spicy food morning, noon and night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:15) (1x <3): Eyebrows
Xander (2013-10-04 12:16) (1x <3): Dem brows
Phil (2013-10-04 12:17): yeaa
Xander (2013-10-04 12:17): There is no God, because He wouldn't let this happen to me on the toilet
Nate (2013-10-04 12:22) (2x <3): I just got on the toilet. Battleshits.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:22) (3x <3): Sandeep:
"That last text was good"

LMAO
Mark (2013-10-04 12:22): i love the other chat
Mark (2013-10-04 12:22) (3x <3): bc if contro can get a date, thats real encouragement
Nate (2013-10-04 12:23): If contro can get a date sending those awful texts too.
Mark (2013-10-04 12:24): Nate, you ready this sunday bro?
Nate (2013-10-04 12:24): I suppose. :)
Mark (2013-10-04 12:25): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/85ec8f500f3f01316d3a1e6549d549e0
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:26) (1x <3): Are you a Chinese!?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:26) (1x <3): That would be so racist if it came from a white person
Mark (2013-10-04 12:26): shes just keeping it real
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:26): Yeah.  Real Racist.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:26) (1x <3): I don't think I could be any less Chinese if I tried :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:27): That's a great line
Mark (2013-10-04 12:27): so, ill text her again sunday afternoon... and will let you know if the mission is still a ago
Nate (2013-10-04 12:28): Okay.
Xander (2013-10-04 12:29) (2x <3): Contro's Guide to Building Instant Repulsion
Nate (2013-10-04 12:29) (1x <3): Gotta give her credit for going out with someone without even knowing their name.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:32): Your text game was both good and funny there Mark.
Mark (2013-10-04 12:33): danke
Mark (2013-10-04 12:33): im passing the baton on to you now
Mark (2013-10-04 12:33): make us proud
Phil (2013-10-04 12:33): bitte

Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:34): Ugh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:35): Poor asshole
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:35): So lemme see if I'm understanding this correctly...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:35): Xander #closes some Kitty Sun, texts her a while, gets her hooked as farck
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:36): Never meets her.  Then Mark starts texting her out of nowhere
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:36): And Nate will be the one she meets on a date?
Mark (2013-10-04 12:36) (2x <3): we have our best men on it
Phil (2013-10-04 12:36): lol that's the jist of it
Nate (2013-10-04 12:36): Yeah basically :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:37): HOLY SHIT
Xander (2013-10-04 12:37): Hahaha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:37): This might become one of the best pickup stories ever
Nate (2013-10-04 12:37): No pressure :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 12:37): I'll be there w/ a film crew
Nate (2013-10-04 12:37): LOL
Xander (2013-10-04 12:38) (2x <3): I already have hidden cameras set up in the bedroom, as is my forte
Nate (2013-10-04 12:38) (1x <3): Damn Xander I shouldn't have left you alone in my place.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:39): When she asks how I'm 'mixed' I'll have to think of something fun to say.
Mark (2013-10-04 12:39) (1x <3): eskimo/cherokee
Nate (2013-10-04 12:40): Was going in that direction yeah
Nate (2013-10-04 12:40): or Kenyan Eskimo
Nate (2013-10-04 12:40): Just to push it even farther
Mark (2013-10-04 12:40) (3x <3): kenyan from the waist down
Nate (2013-10-04 12:40): LMAO
Nate (2013-10-04 12:40): I'm saying that
Xander (2013-10-04 12:42) (1x <3): http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dWsLgMUg1IQJ:www.rooshv.com/is-your-game-sustainable+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
Nate (2013-10-04 12:42): Can't believe I'm doing this :)
Xander (2013-10-04 12:42): After this month of going out an insane amount, I feel like this was the perfect article to read
Phil (2013-10-04 12:44): looks interesting
Mark (2013-10-04 12:45) (2x <3): yeah my wallet and liver have been taking a hit lately
Mark (2013-10-04 12:45): could use a change of pace
Xander (2013-10-04 12:45): I probably shaved a year or two off my life, but the enjoyment I have gotten out of this month is... priceless.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:46) (2x <3): I was actually happy that I didn't have a date last night because I needed a day where I wasn't drinking...
Phil (2013-10-04 12:46) (1x <3): Another example of unsustainability is 10 approach nights. As you get older, your standards shoot up, so soon you don’t even notice ten girls in a club that you want to talk to, preferring maybe only two or three. You will obviously get lower results from such a decrease in attempts made.
Phil (2013-10-04 12:46): that's me in a nut shell right now
Phil (2013-10-04 12:47) (1x <3): @Xander I'm just getting warmed up
Phil (2013-10-04 12:49): "Casually work on your day game backup now so that you are better prepared for its arrival."
Phil (2013-10-04 12:49): that's legit
Xander (2013-10-04 12:50): Yeah, very wise
Nate (2013-10-04 12:51) (2x <3): Day game is so perfect for being lazy.  You can get numbers doing practically anything.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:52): The best number I got yesterday I got after I was done doing daygame and was walking to get food.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:58): Hmm, a girl just called me.  And I have no idea which girl because the damn number was restricted.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:58) (2x <3): She said she was the happy fun girl and that didn't narrow it down.
Nate (2013-10-04 12:59): Apparantly I had a conversation yesterday with her yesterday about going out last night, that I don't remember.
Nate (2013-10-04 13:00): I hope it was that girl I number closed who had a serious boyfriend.  I was about to text her too.
Nate (2013-10-04 13:01): Sounded like her.
Nate (2013-10-04 13:01): I told her to text me later cause I am working.
Nate (2013-10-04 13:06): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/362ef8d00f4501317f8122c7a40cc8a9

Phil (2013-10-04 13:13): she's cute
Nate (2013-10-04 13:23) (1x <3): Hah, just thought of 3 other girls it could be.  Damn.
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-04 13:24): Phil changed name to Philly Phil
Nate (2013-10-04 13:27): Just ran into a girl I haven't seen in years. Is it wrong I want to fuck her out of spite?
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 13:27) (2x <3): its never wrong to want to fuck
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 13:35): #mute
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 13:35): #unmute
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 13:35): hmm
Xander (2013-10-04 14:13): Okay, I'm considering deleting tinder
Xander (2013-10-04 14:14) (1x <3): I'm overly saturated with bitties and it's going to keep my day game from progressing
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:17): Ah shit
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:17): Solid #close during lunch
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:17): Will post creep shot in a min
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:20): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:20): looking forward to checking out her ass
Nate (2013-10-04 14:20) (1x <3): jimmy has advanced to upskirts
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:20): camera on the shoe
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:20): nice
Nate (2013-10-04 14:21) (2x <3): I never would have thought of fucking a girl cause I thought she was annoying until I met you guys
Xander (2013-10-04 14:22): Hahaha
Mark (2013-10-04 14:22): a hole's the goal
Xander (2013-10-04 14:23): Dude, ever want to piss off a feminist? Just tell her about how you want to "hate fuck" a girl
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:27) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/7fbcae500f5001317f8122c7a40cc8a9
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:27): tall
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:27): long hair
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:27): I'm in love
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:28): So...
Mark (2013-10-04 14:29): looks like grand central
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:29): oh yeah it def is
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:30): I'd recognize that floor anywhere
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:30) (2x <3): This is gonna sound like a lie maybe.  She's half korean, half vietnamese.  Red hair (dyed obv).  She is an international lingerie model, flies between Seoul, Tokyo, London & NYC every other week.
Mark (2013-10-04 14:30): ask her to prove it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:30): I had to do a LOT of teasing w/ this one
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:30): it sounds like my wet dreams
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:30): I did, she came up and i poked her abs
Mark (2013-10-04 14:31) (1x <3): where else did you poke her
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:31): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:32): She was surprisingly shy/nervous
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:32) (3x <3): I understand though.  I can be an intimidating figure.
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:32): ah i love htat
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:32): lmao
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:32): ;)
Mark (2013-10-04 14:32): its true
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:33) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/5a7f54000f51013196b33e7f0a9d8165
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:33): is that her?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:33): Yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:34): kinda a weird pic but she's def hot
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:34) (1x <3): I was walking around for 45 min, couldn't do a single approach.  Finally saw her and gathered my nuts.  Talked for 10 min
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:35) (1x <3): Didn't have time to eat lunch, but worth it
Mark (2013-10-04 14:36) (1x <3): soon youll be having taco for lunch
Nate (2013-10-04 14:47) (2x <3): Damn girl left too fast to get a creeper shot. Closed a hot Russian model.
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:49): everyone is fucking day gaming today
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:49) (1x <3): w/e I got two tinder numbers
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:49) (1x <3): I gotta day game later though
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:49) (2x <3): Nate I find that I'm not going after runway models anymore, they're just so flakey and not worth the time/energy investment
Nate (2013-10-04 14:50): I'm guessing she's a model. That was one of the fastest number closes I've ever had.
Nate (2013-10-04 14:52): I'd be surprised if I was with her for more than a minute total from opening moment to us parting.
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:53): sometimes those can work out
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:53): but I'm always worried that I didn't have enough of a solid interaction for her to invest more in me
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:53): when its short
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:54): Yeah generally they're low conversion rates for me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 14:54) (1x <3): I think a sweet spot is 5-10min
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:54): I mean with day game you never know
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:55): at a bar I feel like I have to talk to a girl for a long time or make out with her for her not to flake
Xander (2013-10-04 14:55): My conversion rates are really high across the board
Xander (2013-10-04 14:55): Because I am the second coming
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:55) (3x <3): fuck you and your god like texting
Nate (2013-10-04 14:55) (2x <3): She has already texted me back
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:55): nice ^
Xander (2013-10-04 14:56) (1x <3): @Nate Girl I number closed in 20 seconds outside of Whole Foods is going on date with me tonight
Nate (2013-10-04 14:57): This one commended me on my balls.
Mark (2013-10-04 14:58): good shit guys, keep it up
Mark (2013-10-04 14:58): btw are we still grabbing a pint after work? otherwise im gonna see this girl
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 14:59): I'm down for that
Xander (2013-10-04 15:00): What time were you guys trying to meet? I probably can't make it, to be honest...
Nate (2013-10-04 15:00): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/1f6bb1000f550131414e0e0aca14349b
Nate (2013-10-04 15:00) (1x <3): @Jesus What do you usually text a girl for the first line?  I'm not sure what I should send her tomorrow.
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:00): lets hang out
Nate (2013-10-04 15:00): I'm down for after work
Xander (2013-10-04 15:01): My first line is usually comprised of two components: one boring and one humorous
Mark (2013-10-04 15:02) (1x <3): i think you gotta give her something to sink her teeth into... like in improv, give her an offer
Mark (2013-10-04 15:02): so there convo doesnt just end right there
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:03) (2x <3): dude we gotta do some improv
Xander (2013-10-04 15:03): "Hey, it's Xander from the rooftop last night, eatin your cheetos. Let's get coffee sometime"
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:03): I think like opening the first text isn't super important
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:04): in my opinion
Xander (2013-10-04 15:04): http://www.attractioninstitute.org/inner-game/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/istock_000006710044xsmall-217x300.jpg
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:04) (2x <3): I just try to keep my texting to a minimum cause I suck at it
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:04): just try to get a meet up
Xander (2013-10-04 15:04): Haha
Nate (2013-10-04 15:05): I'm planning to do improv in nov or dec.
Xander (2013-10-04 15:06) (1x <3): I'm down, like Chinatown
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:06) (1x <3): me too
Nate (2013-10-04 15:07) (2x <3): Just as a motivator.  I've been really lazy this week and I think I've still done more day game approaches than all of you together.
Nate (2013-10-04 15:07): Get on it!
Xander (2013-10-04 15:08): I agree with Mark, you need to drop bait for her to want to keep the convo going
Xander (2013-10-04 15:08): Give her a mysterious statement, or whatever
Xander (2013-10-04 15:09): Anything to get her interested in asking questions and finding out more about you
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:09) (1x <3): give us an example
Nate (2013-10-04 15:11): Yeah examples teacher!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 15:12): EXAMPLESSSSS
Mark (2013-10-04 15:14): its all contextual i think... just bring up a few things you talked about during the interaction
Mark (2013-10-04 15:14): as long as you provide 2-3 "hook" words for her to expand on
Nate (2013-10-04 15:15): @Mark except her saying her name was "Russian" when I first introduced myself we literally had no conversation.  I have nothing to build on.
Xander (2013-10-04 15:15): Just read like any text I have ever posted
Mark (2013-10-04 15:15): Nate, did you end the interaction or did she? it seems awfully short
Nate (2013-10-04 15:16): She was in a huge rush.  As soon as she gave me her number she left.
Xander (2013-10-04 15:16): Okay, I'll post my conversation with whole foods girl, since it's a similar situation
Xander (2013-10-04 15:16): Phil has already seen this
Nate (2013-10-04 15:16): Before I approached her she was practically running she was going so fast.
Mark (2013-10-04 15:17): i think as a general rule of thumb, for the first few texts at least, always keep it easy going
Mark (2013-10-04 15:17) (2x <3): your goal is to make her smile
Mark (2013-10-04 15:17): which you've done
Mark (2013-10-04 15:18): dont do anything double edged or prone to misinterpretation
Nate (2013-10-04 15:18): Yeah I tried doing that before to disasterous results.
Mark (2013-10-04 15:19): this is only for the first few texts
Mark (2013-10-04 15:19): also depends on where your interaction left off
Xander (2013-10-04 15:19) (1x <3): I think that ambiguity is the heart of seduction
Nate (2013-10-04 15:19): I'm probably the worst texter her, so I don't trust my instincts.
Nate (2013-10-04 15:19): here
Xander (2013-10-04 15:20): I'm not at all afraid to lose girls through texting, which emboldened me to try crazy shit
Xander (2013-10-04 15:21): *emboldens
Nate (2013-10-04 15:21): Oh I've been trying crazy shit believe me.  One of the advantages of being able to get numbers without trying it being able to lose them.
Nate (2013-10-04 15:21): But it never hurts to get a jump start.
Nate (2013-10-04 15:23): I hope that girl from earlier texts me, I still am not sure who she was...
Nate (2013-10-04 15:25): Charlie of Kickassery just friend requested me on facebook.
Xander (2013-10-04 15:28): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:28) (1x <3): @Xander I think the red pill stuff about love I've always done
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:28): http://therationalmale.com/2012/09/11/of-love-and-war/ I've always thought this way
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:29): when I'm in a relationship I usually don't even care if the girl loves me I just assume she does
Xander (2013-10-04 15:45): https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8sgBV4EIfFeR1paaFNhbWhxQnc/edit?usp=sharing
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 15:46): lol okay jesus
Xander (2013-10-04 15:46): @Nate, that's the transcipt for whole foods girl tonight
Nate (2013-10-04 15:46): Thanks Jesus!
Xander (2013-10-04 15:49) (1x <3): Truly I tell you, It is hard for a thirsty man to pass into the gates of poosy paradise. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is desperate to enter the kingdom of cooch.
Xander (2013-10-04 15:52): This conversation wasn't even that great, but I was mostly trying to remind her that I exist before our date
Nate (2013-10-04 16:03): Yeah that seems fairly mundane
Nate (2013-10-04 16:04) (1x <3): I did notice a definite lack of smileys and !'s
Nate (2013-10-04 16:04) (1x <3): For that matter any punctuation
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 16:04) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/243303100f5e013199b67206cee2988f

Philly Phil (2013-10-04 16:07): I like the don't give me a straight answer thing
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 16:07): I text better when I don't think too much
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 16:08): Ugh.  This bitch.

Me: Sup, are we hanging out later?
Her: No.. I was so drunk yesterday night.  Still on bed.
Me. Charming
Her: Don't think too much. I won't end up in your bed
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 16:09): turn it around on her
Philly Phil (2013-10-04 16:09): she said it not you
Xander (2013-10-04 16:09): "No one said you were invited"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-04 16:10): This text convo is dying a painful death
Xander (2013-10-04 16:11): Might as well go out with a bang
Xander (2013-10-04 16:15): "Why do you talk about beds so much, are you a bed salesman or something"

Nate (2013-10-05 20:31): Make up a different name
Nate (2013-10-05 20:33): At least I was smart enough not to mention I know you unless you said it was okay even when I knew who it was
Nate (2013-10-06 10:07): Morning closers
Nate (2013-10-06 11:41): Archer gives me this wonderful insult "You are as dumb as you are stupid"
Xander (2013-10-06 14:29): uuuuuughhh

Xander (2013-10-06 14:33): Looks like I'm taking the day off
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:42): @xander I asked Erin out

Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:47): Xander's friend from San Fran
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:47): Super cute
Xander (2013-10-06 14:48): Well, I give up. Was supposed to have a date today but I'm flaking

Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:51): Uhh
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:51): What
Nate (2013-10-06 14:53) (3x <3): Xander, just because your covered in plague and dying of alchohol poisoning and lack of sleep, don't let that stop you from getting an std this week!
Nate (2013-10-06 14:55): Damn that was harsh, even for me
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 14:55): Hahaha classic
Xander (2013-10-06 14:59): I'm losing my core. I'm becoming nothing but a shallow patchwork of phrases and bullshit calculated to draw females into my fabricated world.
Xander (2013-10-06 15:02): And once they're there, I can only allow them to stay long enough for me to bang them once or twice; any longer and the thin patina starts to flake off, revealing the yawning emotional chasm within.
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 15:02) (1x <3): Wow well that's fucking depressing
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 15:03) (1x <3): Maybe you should take a break Xander
Mark A (2013-10-06 15:10) (1x <3): Xander it looks like it's been a good two weeks for u
Mark A (2013-10-06 15:15): Who's the other mark. Have we met
Nate (2013-10-06 15:17) (1x <3): This is gonna get so confusing
Mark A (2013-10-06 15:19): Haha
Mark A (2013-10-06 15:20): I was here first haha
Hot Tongs (2013-10-06 15:31): @xander are you joking?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-06 15:31): haha no one will take meseriously with this name
Nate (2013-10-06 15:32) (1x <3): @Mark A, isn't that not your real name tho? :)
Nate (2013-10-06 15:32): Okay, sent about 30 ping texts...
Nate (2013-10-06 15:35): Next time my ping text will be cat facts.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-06 15:35): whats a ping text?
Nate (2013-10-06 15:36): Any number that's dead that I actually care at all about I send off random shit to at least once a week.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-06 15:36): lol i do that too.. with the cheezburger app
Nate (2013-10-06 15:37): Every once in a while it results in a live one
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 15:50): I'm meeting Portia today. She's my new favorite
Nate (2013-10-06 15:51) (1x <3): That the chick from Friday night?
Nate (2013-10-06 15:51): I have a hard time remembering the names of the girls I'm dating
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 15:53): Yes lol I dig her more than any other girl I've met so far
Nate (2013-10-06 15:54) (1x <3): Love is in the air!
Nate (2013-10-06 16:10) (1x <3): At your wedding I get first dibs on the brides maids
Philly Phil (2013-10-06 16:13) (1x <3): Deal
Xander (2013-10-06 22:15): Just found a little note card with some girl's name/number on it while cleaning out a drawer. NYC area code, so I must have gotten it since moving here, but probably a couple months old. Would You Ping?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-06 23:17) (1x <3): Why not can't hurt right?
Xander (2013-10-06 23:18): If it doesn't go well, I'm gonna end it all.
Xander (2013-10-06 23:19): j/k

Xander (2013-10-07 01:06): Me
Nate (2013-10-07 01:07) (1x <3): I flaked on your girl :(
Nate (2013-10-07 01:08): I hope Mark got a message to her, I feel a little bad about that.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:09): What happened?
Nate (2013-10-07 01:10) (1x <3): I went for a walk before my date.  Ran into this absolutely stunning hatian girl.  She had hit something and didn't notice (which I had a lot of fun with), and was looking for the piece that fell off her mirror.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:10) (1x <3): I walked with her while she found it, and then she gave me a ride back to my place.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:11) (2x <3): We then pretty much made out for an hour or so as we got slowly naked, and then had a bunch of sex.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:11) (1x <3): I didn't expect to flake, but she was already at my place, and well...
Xander (2013-10-07 01:12): Jesus Christ
Nate (2013-10-07 01:12): Yeah
Nate (2013-10-07 01:13) (2x <3): I REALLY love teasing now.  That pretty much got me laid.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:13) (1x <3): That's awesome
Nate (2013-10-07 01:14): Not sure if your girl still wants to go out after I flaked on her, but I'll text Mark tomorrow about it.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:15): Yeah, it's all good
Xander (2013-10-07 01:15) (1x <3): I'm glad that my teasing advice has been able to help you destroy so much pussy lately
Nate (2013-10-07 01:15): This girl had such a fantastic body.  And oh my god tight.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:16): It really has made a huge difference.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:16): I was having a shitty day too.  Every approach before that was horrendous.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:17) (1x <3): I hope she was clean.  I ended up not having a condom on half the time, which kinda defeats the purpose.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:18): Haha
Nate (2013-10-07 01:18) (1x <3): How has the girl never gotten pregnant though.  She said she just got off her period, so can't get pregnant.  So full of shit.  I'm glad I pulled out before I got close.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:18) (1x <3): I love how I asked Phil's neighbor if she had given me anything when this rash began
Nate (2013-10-07 01:18): I hope...
Xander (2013-10-07 01:19): Doctor thought it was just poison ivt
Xander (2013-10-07 01:19): *ivy
Nate (2013-10-07 01:19): That's good
Xander (2013-10-07 01:20) (1x <3): I can't fucking stand my living situation any more
Xander (2013-10-07 01:20) (1x <3): One of the reasons I have been going out so much is so that I don't ever have to be hjere
Nate (2013-10-07 01:21): Ahh
Nate (2013-10-07 01:21): God that was dumb of me
Xander (2013-10-07 01:22) (1x <3): Hey man, I have been playing with fire a lot too lately
Nate (2013-10-07 01:22) (1x <3): Hopefully my pre-ejacuate sperm is weak.  I don't want any haitan kids
Xander (2013-10-07 01:22) (1x <3): Maybe I should move in with R schmitty
Nate (2013-10-07 01:23): Yeah if your living situation sucks, you really should fix it.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:24): It's affecting my inner game
Xander (2013-10-07 01:24): I feel like a worthless piece of shit when I go home
Xander (2013-10-07 01:25): And I can't pull any girls here
Nate (2013-10-07 01:26) (1x <3): Yeah, find a better place then.
Xander (2013-10-07 01:30): I feel like I came dangerously close to burning out
Xander (2013-10-07 01:30): If I hadn't slept all of today, it would have happened
Nate (2013-10-07 01:31) (1x <3): Yeah, you need your down time.  I take at least 1 day a week to just de-stress.
Nate (2013-10-07 01:32): Otherwise you'll go batty
Xander (2013-10-07 01:33): I fucking hate my roommate
Nate (2013-10-07 01:33): Yeah, it's time for you to find a new place
Xander (2013-10-07 01:34): Keep it together, Xandy, keep it goether
Nate (2013-10-07 01:34): Go to your happy place
Xander (2013-10-07 01:35): My happy place...
Xander (2013-10-07 01:37): I'm going to go through my phone and delete a few text messages/numbers
Xander (2013-10-07 01:37) (1x <3): For the people I don't want to bother trying to contact again because they're either bitchy or physically repulsive
Nate (2013-10-07 01:38): yeah no point in cluttering your phone with that
Xander (2013-10-07 01:38) (1x <3): I'm letting the soothing sounds of Four Tet guide me on my quest
Xander (2013-10-07 01:41): Want to see how shitty I was even a month ago?
Nate (2013-10-07 01:42): Umm sure
Xander (2013-10-07 01:48): https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8sgBV4EIfFeamlNeWNrYzVmUXM/edit?usp=sharing
Xander (2013-10-07 01:48): Wow, that is truly painful for me to read
Nate (2013-10-07 01:49): Wow you are Mr. Negative whiner
Xander (2013-10-07 01:49): Practically non-existent teasing and playfulness, desperation seeping through in every message
Xander (2013-10-07 01:50): I just can't even believe that I had such a text exchange a few months ago
Xander (2013-10-07 01:51): Compared to now
Nate (2013-10-07 01:51): Yeah its not even fun in any way
Xander (2013-10-07 01:53): So you think I'm Mr. Whineypants?
Nate (2013-10-07 01:54): In that text exchange yeah
Xander (2013-10-07 01:54): Yep
Xander (2013-10-07 01:57) (1x <3): Phil's neighbor said she loves my chest hair yesterday
Xander (2013-10-07 01:57) (2x <3): Score one for the hairy dudes
Nate (2013-10-07 01:58) (1x <3): Same tonight
Xander (2013-10-07 02:01): So tell me more about your pinging strategy
Xander (2013-10-07 02:02): I'm usually all about the fewer leads, higher conversation rates
Xander (2013-10-07 02:02): But this intrigues me. I want to squeeze every last drop out of my leads
Nate (2013-10-07 02:02): I just send random stuff like "What sort of trouble are you causing" and "It's Friday, dance on your desk!"
Nate (2013-10-07 02:02): Every once in a while a girl replies
Nate (2013-10-07 02:03): and conversation picks up
Xander (2013-10-07 02:03): Nice, haha
Nate (2013-10-07 02:04): At least a dozen times girls I haven't heard anything from in months have suggested we go out after I just blind texted them for that time.
Nate (2013-10-07 02:04): Always light, flirty, or random shit
Nate (2013-10-07 02:04): Sometimes I just ask them out too
Xander (2013-10-07 02:04): When do you consider a lead "dead"?
Xander (2013-10-07 02:04): Like, after a week?
Nate (2013-10-07 02:05): Yeah, if she hasn't replied at all.  It's dead
Nate (2013-10-07 02:05): Or stops replying
Xander (2013-10-07 02:05): Okay, what if I stop sending messages
Xander (2013-10-07 02:05): Because that happens just as often with me as them not replying. Maybe MORE often...
Xander (2013-10-07 02:05): Since I get caught up in new leads
Nate (2013-10-07 02:06): Well since you stopped, you can just start up again.
Xander (2013-10-07 02:06): Good call. I feel retarded right now
Nate (2013-10-07 02:06): One of the dates this week was a girl I literally hadn't talked to in 2 years
Xander (2013-10-07 02:08): Whoah, haha
Xander (2013-10-07 02:10) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0d386b7011450131679a4a1e3106701c
Nate (2013-10-07 02:10): lol
Xander (2013-10-07 02:11): Being playful is so key
Nate (2013-10-07 02:13): Yep :)
Xander (2013-10-07 02:13): Man, I meet a lot of girls at Solas.
Nate (2013-10-07 02:14): Apparantly
Nate (2013-10-07 02:14): Cute girl
Xander (2013-10-07 02:15): Oh, Angel is actually a friend that my friend Erin threw to me
Nate (2013-10-07 02:15): lol
Xander (2013-10-07 02:15) (2x <3): The one that Phil and I hung out with on Saturday and he wants to bone
Nate (2013-10-07 02:17): Does she know that?
Xander (2013-10-07 02:17): Probably, since he and I kept talking about our sexual exploits
Nate (2013-10-07 02:17): lol
Nate (2013-10-07 02:21): Okay, I gotta go sleep, I'm pretty exhausted
Xander (2013-10-07 02:22) (2x <3): Alright dude, see you on the other side
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 09:25): *brother
Nate (2013-10-07 09:36): Morning
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:03): yo yo
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:04): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4582b870118701317de962fd74a41233
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:04): got rejectedddddd
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:04) (2x <3): lol I actually wasn't too into her either but I did want to bang her
Nate (2013-10-07 10:09) (2x <3): However will you cope.  You'll be forced to have sex with a girl you like more.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:09): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:10): whatever I'm 90% sure I met my next gf
Nate (2013-10-07 10:10): Yeah I gathered
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:10): yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:11): I almost saw her last night
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:11) (1x <3): I'm gonna try to set up a meet for thursday though
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:11): I have two dates today and one tuesday and one wednesday
Nate (2013-10-07 10:11): I actually have nothing at all confirmed yet for this week
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:11): wednesday is really hot
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:11): ah okay
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:12): well number 2 for today is not confirmed
Nate (2013-10-07 10:12) (2x <3): Had some pretty mind blowing sex last night though, so I'm not too caring
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:12): I heard
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:12): you got a pic of that girl
Nate (2013-10-07 10:13): I don't.  She wouldn't send me one and we were too naked by the time i thought to take one.
Xander (2013-10-07 10:13) (1x <3): Morning anuses
Nate (2013-10-07 10:13): I'll get one next weekend.  Planning to have her over again.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:13): nice ^
Nate (2013-10-07 10:13): Really hot
Nate (2013-10-07 10:14) (1x <3): and she can deep throat...
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:14): uhh
Nate (2013-10-07 10:14): :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:14) (2x <3): so I won't be able to get any work done today
Xander (2013-10-07 10:15): Phil, Emily wants me to go away with her for a day or two this weekend
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:15): you should
Xander (2013-10-07 10:15): Housesitting while her parents are out of town
Nate (2013-10-07 10:15): You need a break, sounds perfect.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:15): you can have some nasty ass sex
Xander (2013-10-07 10:15): I already flaked on mini golf last night
Xander (2013-10-07 10:16): With Angel
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:16): Erin never texted me back
Xander (2013-10-07 10:16): Go figure
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:16) (2x <3): she probably thinks i'm too much of a player
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:16): I'm not too broken up
Xander (2013-10-07 10:17) (1x <3): She also said that you looked a little like her ex-boyfriend, that is before he turned into a fat pile of shit
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:17): lol well then
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:17): she's already comparing me to her ex
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:17): that should be a shoe in
Xander (2013-10-07 10:49): I'm guessing none of you got what I just sent
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:50): nope
Xander (2013-10-07 10:51): Internet here's a little fucked
Xander (2013-10-07 10:51): I said I was going to PM you and Nate the spreadsheet I made last night
Xander (2013-10-07 10:52): Since I don't feel like hiding the sensitive information
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:55): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:55): I like it
Nate (2013-10-07 10:55): :)
Xander (2013-10-07 10:55): That's what is left over after culling some numbers
Xander (2013-10-07 10:55): The weaklings had to go
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 10:56): yeah I should do something similar today
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:17): So Phlly Phil
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:17): Who's your chick?  Where'd ya meet her?
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:17): friday night
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:17): with nate at solas
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:18): she's the fourth pic in the gallery
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:18): Is that a pretty accurate pic of her?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:18): Would u say?
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:19): yep
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:19): actually I think she looks better in person
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:20): OK gud cuz I thought in this pic she has sliiightly man-ish features
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:20): And u could probably do better
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:21): haha yeah well
Nate (2013-10-07 11:21): That's makeup
Xander (2013-10-07 11:21): Models tend to have slightly mannish features
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:23): I'm just nitpicking really, she's cute bro
Nate (2013-10-07 11:24): Looks fade, personality matters most
Xander (2013-10-07 11:25): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/supermodels-are-not-hot/
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:26): How was yalls' weekends?
Xander (2013-10-07 11:28): Ran into a Colombian girl at Solas again who I thought had blown me off before. Turns out that she had entered her number in my phone wrong
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:29): Cool.  You vibin?
Xander (2013-10-07 11:29): Well, we commended making out again
Xander (2013-10-07 11:29): *commenced
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:30): Lately I've been finding it really difficult to find anything I like @ nightgame
Xander (2013-10-07 11:30): I feel like I keep finding girls who are hot and attracted to me, but they are purposely slow-rolling the relationship
Xander (2013-10-07 11:31): "Well, wait another week and then we'll go on a date, and maybe I'll let you do more than just kiss me!"
Xander (2013-10-07 11:31): Goddamn girl game
Xander (2013-10-07 11:31): Trying to get me invested...
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:31) (2x <3): @jimmy she's like the coolest chick ever so any looks things I can totally over look
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:31) (1x <3): pretty dorky shy and nerdy
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:32) (1x <3): I love it
Nate (2013-10-07 11:33): @Xander maybe they think you're not opening up enough about yourself
Xander (2013-10-07 11:33): Not true.
Xander (2013-10-07 11:34): I think that they actually like me as more than just a single fuck, so they are trying to get me invested in things by applying the brakes a little bit
Nate (2013-10-07 11:34): Also possible
Xander (2013-10-07 11:34): At least, that's what it seems to be for like 70% of them
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:35) (2x <3): Philly Phil that sounds pretty awesome, to like a chick for her personality.  Can't remember the last time I felt that for a girl
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:35): Excluding my last serious gf
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:37) (1x <3): And yeah Xandy...a girl's MO is going to be "how can I keep this guy", playing the long game, tryin to get u as invested as possible..
Xander (2013-10-07 11:38): Damnit, wanted to link ya'll to a baby-makin' music song, but it keeps getting taking down
Xander (2013-10-07 11:38): Phil's neighbor Emily is kinda acting more like the stage five clinger from Wedding Crashers
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:39): she's cute man
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:39): I dig her face
Xander (2013-10-07 11:39): She's very strange looking
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 11:39): hahah
Xander (2013-10-07 11:40): Anyway, if any of you have spotify or unlimited google music, check out this song
Xander (2013-10-07 11:40): Moderat - Let in the Light
Xander (2013-10-07 11:40) (1x <3): @Philly Phil Sometimes I think she's hot, and other times I'm just like, "Uhhhh..."
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:47) (1x <3): https://play.spotify.com/track/1ErKxzbbcuOUZMrHmenNPG
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 11:47): Omg I think I am literally getting pregnant right now
Xander (2013-10-07 11:47): Hahaha
Nate (2013-10-07 12:23) (1x <3): FYI alot of stuff has been clicking lately for me mostly because of you guys...
Nate (2013-10-07 12:24): @Mark the asian one.  If you come online let me know.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 12:48): for those dead leads
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 12:49): I think I should text them ridiculous shit like this "taco cats spelled backwards is taco cats"
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 12:49): I mean cat singular
Nate (2013-10-07 12:50): I basically alternate ridicous and just comments about the day or the week, or weather, or whatever
Nate (2013-10-07 12:50): Not that my advice is perfect, being that I'm not the greatest texter
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 12:50): whateves
Nate (2013-10-07 12:50): Main thing is persistence.  I just keep texting them
Xander (2013-10-07 12:52): Don't ask me. I don't give away all my trade secrets
Nate (2013-10-07 12:53) (1x <3): 3 easy payments of $14.95
Xander (2013-10-07 12:53) (1x <3): Perhaps I should start running a text game seminar
Xander (2013-10-07 12:53): I'm pretty desperate for cash at the moment...
Mark (2013-10-07 15:09): im back
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:09): hi mark
Nate (2013-10-07 15:09): Hey Mark
Mark (2013-10-07 15:10) (1x <3): still feel hungover from the weekend
Nate (2013-10-07 15:11): Any chance you got a message to Kitty so she didn't show up to noone?
Mark (2013-10-07 15:11) (1x <3): so, she totally got stood up
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:11): oh I was gonna ask you about that LUmi
Mark (2013-10-07 15:12) (1x <3): i left my phone at home and was out with a girl sunday eve

Mark (2013-10-07 15:12): when i came back, i saw like a bazillion msgs
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:12): shit lumi you should have texted me
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:12): I would have went
Nate (2013-10-07 15:12): I met a girl and took her home to my place 2 hrs before the date
Mark (2013-10-07 15:12): well
Mark (2013-10-07 15:13): i hope she found someone there
Nate (2013-10-07 15:13): Crap
Mark (2013-10-07 15:13): :|
Nate (2013-10-07 15:15): Maybe I'll text her. Explain there was a mix up, and see if she still wants to meet
Mark (2013-10-07 15:16): hm yeah good idea
Mark (2013-10-07 15:17): dont want to have her hating guys because of this... ha
Mark (2013-10-07 15:17): or developing trust issues
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:18): ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:18): common she got stood up once
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:18): big deal
Nate (2013-10-07 15:18) (1x <3): On the plus side, totally worth it.  So fun last night.
Mark (2013-10-07 15:19): yeah youre right Phil, probably not a huge deal
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:21): Sup mark

Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:30): Talent wise
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:32): Pretty annoying also that all these foreign chicks are leaving in the next day or two
Mark (2013-10-07 15:32): those two cute argentinians were the highlight of the night

(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-07 15:46): Jimmyayo changed the group's avatar
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:46): Just kidding
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:46): Did you see them in any sets?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 15:46): I only saw them prowling around like a pair of hyenas
Mark (2013-10-07 15:46): did they even come up to the rooftop?
Mark (2013-10-07 15:46): didnt see them
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:47): wait so

Philly Phil (2013-10-07 15:48): lol he's so fucking strange
Nate (2013-10-07 15:59): Kitty is either really adventurous or really desperate. I hope the former.  We're on for tomorrow night.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:00): wait so how did you text her
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:00): does she still think you're mark
Nate (2013-10-07 16:00): I said it was a long story, but that was my friend's phone
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:00) (1x <3): oh sick
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:00) (1x <3): good story
Nate (2013-10-07 16:00): So she thinks I'm one person
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:00) (1x <3): yeah nice
Nate (2013-10-07 16:01): This is either going to turn out to be a fun time, or resulting in me getting a restraining order on her.
Mark (2013-10-07 16:02): i told her we met at a party btw
Nate (2013-10-07 16:02): Haha, I told her we never met
Mark (2013-10-07 16:03): she aint the sharpest tool in the shed
Nate (2013-10-07 16:03): Seems like it
Nate (2013-10-07 16:03) (1x <3): I'll give her a good time.
Nate (2013-10-07 16:05): Except when contro was out with Ecstatic and he was making him do crazy shit, my only experience with contro gaming was when he was rapey kissing a girl at Solas.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:05): gross
Nate (2013-10-07 16:05): I did have lunch with him once though, seemed like a nice guy
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07): oh I know he is
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07): but I wouldn't want him gaming my sister
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07): if you know what I mean
Nate (2013-10-07 16:07): I do, wink wink
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07): or my cousin
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07) (1x <3): you could have my sister
Mark (2013-10-07 16:07) (1x <3): what a gentleman
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:07): lol
Nate (2013-10-07 16:08) (1x <3): Do you have a sister? :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09) (1x <3): yes
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09): she's married
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09): and off limits
Nate (2013-10-07 16:09): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09): :D
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09): I actually have a pretty ugly family
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:09): except for a few hot cousins
Nate (2013-10-07 16:09): Good enough
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:10): in my opinion
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 16:10): lol
Nate (2013-10-07 16:10): :)
Xander (2013-10-07 16:41) (1x <3): So I'm picking up my prednisone now

Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:15): that's how she's put in my contacts
Nate (2013-10-07 17:15): Sounds like a good one for cal..Deleted..
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:15): lol
Xander (2013-10-07 17:53): Damn. So many those 5 months weren't worthless if they lead to so many dead leads
Xander (2013-10-07 17:57): @Nate I still can't believe you left Kitty high and dry. She's probably going to die of loneliness now.
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:57): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:58) (2x <3): its so hard to not be needy
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:58) (2x <3): I want to text this girl so bad but I fucking can't
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 17:58): Why can't you?
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:58): I need her to text me first
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 17:59): WUT
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 17:59): WHY
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:59): just because
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:59): I've already given her too much pull
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:59): I need to give her room to wonder about me
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 17:59): to think about if I actually like her or not
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:00): I want her to be more insecure
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:00): basically
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 18:00): Oh
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:00): plus its way too early
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:00): to give her too much
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 18:00): Gotcha. Later in the week, just tell her ur going to this awesome party but don't invite her haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:01): exactly

Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:03): she stayed the night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 18:03) (1x <3): If ur starting to feel like ur falling for her this early, just remember that somewhere in that hot body is a crazy bitch in hiding
Jimmyayo (2013-10-07 18:04) (1x <3): It's always just a matter of time for the crazy to reveal itself
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:04): lol I know it
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:04): its fine the girl I'm meeting on wednesday is hotter than her
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 18:04): which helps

Mark A (2013-10-07 20:03): She is staying somewhere near Madison Sq garden so I don't want to go far.
Nate (2013-10-07 20:03): If you want somewhere really cool, take her to Raines Law Room
Nate (2013-10-07 20:04): No dancing, but awesome drinks and atmosphere

Philly Phil (2013-10-07 20:15): really fucking cute a lot cuter than her pictures
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 20:15): I had to up her lvl in my spread sheet
Xander (2013-10-07 20:17) (1x <3): I can tell that Phil is like one date away from catching one-itis

Xander (2013-10-07 21:03): That whole group is so hopeless...
Xander (2013-10-07 21:03): I was sending a friend of mine screen captures of their text messages, and he was just like, "Wow..."
Nate (2013-10-07 21:04) (2x <3): My half drunk stupid text ideas are better than theirs
Xander (2013-10-07 21:05): I want to be half drunk...
Nate (2013-10-07 21:05): Yes, feel free to tell the girl how they suck.  That'll get them to want to go out with you.
Nate (2013-10-07 21:05) (1x <3): @Xander I like alchohol
Nate (2013-10-07 21:06) (1x <3): Contro, god's gift to women

Nate (2013-10-07 21:11) (1x <3): DO IT
Xander (2013-10-07 21:11) (1x <3): RAHHHHHHHH!!!!
Xander (2013-10-07 21:15): Send aaaand sent. I'm kind of expecting the conversation to end after that, but whatever
Xander (2013-10-07 21:15) (1x <3): Better too bold than too meek
Nate (2013-10-07 21:15) (1x <3): Or get awesome
Nate (2013-10-07 21:17): So many ways that girl from last night was awesome. So many.

Nate (2013-10-07 21:21): or "So that means you do.  Maybe for my birthday"
Nate (2013-10-07 21:22): or "So that means you do.  Now where can we get a big snake to go with it"
Xander (2013-10-07 21:23): I like that one
Nate (2013-10-07 21:23): Me too
Xander (2013-10-07 21:24): Except, instead of "we just met", "I want to take things slow"
Nate (2013-10-07 21:24): better
Xander (2013-10-07 21:25): "Ah, so you do. Not yet though, I want to take things slow"
Nate (2013-10-07 21:25): I like the snake one tho ;)
Xander (2013-10-07 21:26): Yeah, but we didn't get that sexualized on our first date, just some making out right before parting ways
Xander (2013-10-07 21:26) (1x <3): I like setting the frame that she is the one who wants to jump into my pants, but I'm trying to take things slow
Nate (2013-10-07 21:26): Met too, that's what I did all yesterday :)
Nate (2013-10-07 21:26): Me
Nate (2013-10-07 21:27): I still like the snake thing, just for the coolness :)

Philly Phil (2013-10-07 21:32): I would bang that chick and her snake
Xander (2013-10-07 21:32): It's like all of these girls are running in the same script
Philly Phil (2013-10-07 21:33): lol
Xander (2013-10-07 21:33): Rachel Weisz, I believe
Nate (2013-10-07 21:33): You believe right
Nate (2013-10-07 21:34): "This is though.  Wednesday at <My favorite bar>.  No snakes unfortunately.  Let's meet at 8pm"
Nate (2013-10-07 21:35) (1x <3): I laugh because I'm trying to give Xander texting advice....

Mark (2013-10-08 10:49): good movie
Mark (2013-10-08 10:50): lots of euro trance
Nate (2013-10-08 10:50): My dreams last night were a Run Lola Run movie, except the topic was my date tonight.
Mark (2013-10-08 10:50): arent you seeing kitty tonight
Nate (2013-10-08 10:50): I am
Mark (2013-10-08 10:51) (1x <3): shes like the only one who makes you nervous hahaha
Mark (2013-10-08 10:51) (1x <3): your kryptonite
Nate (2013-10-08 10:51): Mostly because of how this happened :)
Nate (2013-10-08 10:51): Although I'm less nervous now that I took control a bit
Mark (2013-10-08 10:51): itll be a good story to tell your grandkids
Nate (2013-10-08 10:51): haha yeah
Mark (2013-10-08 10:51) (1x <3): "this is how i met your grandma"
Xander (2013-10-08 10:52): Cacaw!
Xander (2013-10-08 10:53): Can't believe Kitty's STILL willing to see you. Thirsty much?
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 10:53): she wants it
Nate (2013-10-08 10:53): She must, she knows nothing at all about me
Nate (2013-10-08 10:54) (1x <3): I wonder if she looks anything like the actress who played her in my dreams
Mark (2013-10-08 10:54): it was meant to be
Mark (2013-10-08 10:55): alright lads, im going to do some "work"... see yall at 1
Mark (2013-10-08 10:55): nate ur coming right
Nate (2013-10-08 10:56): As long as you're not having that 3 way with each other.  4 dicks is too many.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 10:56): 1pm, Rock Center
Mark (2013-10-08 10:56): well find an opening for you, nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 10:56): where is that?
Nate (2013-10-08 10:56): Cool
Nate (2013-10-08 10:57): https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=rockefeller+center&fb=1&gl=us&hq=rockefeller+center&hnear=0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62,New+York,+NY&cid=0,0,3734087314244816034&ei=Mh1UUoDDEoXY9ATMmIDIDQ&ved=0CMwBEPwS
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 10:57): kay
Nate (2013-10-08 10:57): Just so you know that place is pretty huge
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 10:59) (1x <3): yeah I literally work around the corner from there
Nate (2013-10-08 11:29): god contro is short sighted.
Xander (2013-10-08 11:30): Yeah man, he's fucked
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:30): I left gay life
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:30) (2x <3): I can only deal with it now in small doses
Xander (2013-10-08 11:32) (1x <3): Just left GayLife again
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:33): I'm having anxiety issues today
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:33): fuck me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 11:34): Wussup phil
Xander (2013-10-08 11:34): @Philly Phil With girls or work or just in general?
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:35): somewhat girls but mostly just in gerneral
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:35) (1x <3): I'm trying to meditate and do some breathing shit it usually helps
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 11:38): There's a really good 10min breathing/meditation routine I found recently, its helped me reduce stress
Xander (2013-10-08 11:39) (1x <3): I feel like my anxiety has all but disappeared since running game 5+ days a week
Xander (2013-10-08 11:39): It really gets me out of my own head
Xander (2013-10-08 11:44): http://krauserpua.com/2013/10/07/the-chosen-few/
Xander (2013-10-08 11:48): @Philly Phil I have dealt with a lot of anxiety shit before, if you ever need someone to talk to
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:49): I very rarely get anxious
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:49): or stressed
Nate (2013-10-08 11:49) (1x <3): Up until I started having dates almost daily, I would get nervous before every single date.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:49): oh I'm not usually nervous about that anymore
Xander (2013-10-08 11:49): Yeah, I'm not nervous for dates any more
Nate (2013-10-08 11:49): Well not any more usually
Xander (2013-10-08 11:49) (1x <3): I'm more nervous that she's gonna suck
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:49): lol
Xander (2013-10-08 11:52) (1x <3): She needs to be an all-around amazing, beautiful woman, since I'm looking for the One!
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 11:59) (1x <3): such a troll
Xander (2013-10-08 11:59): Hahaha
Xander (2013-10-08 11:59): I can't turn it off any more; it has become my default state
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:00): I mean I would actually mean that except for the one part
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:00): I'm not looking for the one just an amazing beautiful woman
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:00) (1x <3): haha just texted portia and I had the app opened saw her immediately type something and then erase it
Xander (2013-10-08 12:00): Read that Krauser article if you dare
Nate (2013-10-08 12:00) (2x <3): There are things you can do with a long term girl though you can't do with one night stands.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:01) (2x <3): she's girl gaming me
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:01): I agree
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:01) (1x <3): you actually find out who someone is
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:01): when you date them longer
Nate (2013-10-08 12:02) (1x <3): Also you can take trips and actually think about what you're going to do and see instead of who you're meeting
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 12:12): Shit, I think my colleague just learned his dad died
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:13): that fucking sucks
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:13): I remember that moment for me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 12:13): Your father passed away?
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:13): when I was 18
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:13): I went and hid in the woods and got really drunk on whisky
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:14) (2x <3): also called my gf which was a bad idea as she was 15
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 12:15) (1x <3): On the bright side...

I have this office all to myself for the next few days!  MUHAHAHA
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 12:15): =(
Nate (2013-10-08 12:15): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:20): did you know people who are crucified die of suffocation not starvation because their chests collapse in on themselves from not being supported
Nate (2013-10-08 12:21): That's....really gruesome
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:22): yeah pretty awful way to die
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:23): humans are fucked up
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:25): of course there's way worse ways to die
Nate (2013-10-08 12:25): Definiteily
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:26) (1x <3): one of the worst I ever heard was in iraq they super glue gay men's assholes closed and then slowly feed them laxatives until they die
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 12:26) (2x <3): lol ahhh what has this chat become because of me
Nate (2013-10-08 13:00): Where we meeting?
Xander (2013-10-08 13:05) (1x <3): @Nate I can't wait to hear about the latest Kitty Sun saga!
Xander (2013-10-08 13:05): I'm going to record the whole thing. Just tell me where to be.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 14:39): I'll be there too
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 14:40) (1x <3): with my date
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 14:40): I'll keep an eye on him
Nate (2013-10-08 14:47): It's going to be quite crazy
Nate (2013-10-08 14:47) (2x <3): Xander don't show up, your manliness will make her ignore me
Nate (2013-10-08 14:57) (1x <3): Dinner confirmed Saturday night.  Yummy in every definition of the word.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:03): So, I sense that I'm getting a lot of buyer's remorse from the girls I get makeouts with
Xander (2013-10-08 15:04): Like, they seem to enjoy our night together a lot, and then they never want to hang out again.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:05): Perhaps it's because I push things hard and they are into it because they are somewhat inebriated and I'm engaging their lizard brain, but then later their logical forebrain kicks back in and starts to generate reasons for why I'm not a good mate or something
Nate (2013-10-08 15:06) (1x <3): I find when that happens it's because I never spent enough time qualifying them so they know I liked them more than just as a piece of ass.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:06): Shit...
Nate (2013-10-08 15:06): Well that's one possible reason anyway
Nate (2013-10-08 15:07): If you find girls your with asking you why you like them, then that could be it.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:07): I don't even know
Xander (2013-10-08 15:07): I'm just getting annoyed and want to delete 90% of my numbers
Nate (2013-10-08 15:08): Don't do things when your angry, it's never a good idea.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:08) (3x <3): But that's... most of the time...
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:09): hahaha
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:10): I need to get more bitches
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:10): even though I have a lot I know that some of them are going to drop off the radar
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 15:11) (3x <3): Great grabbing lunch w/ you guys!
Mark (2013-10-08 15:11) (1x <3): Xander, i've been having that same problem lately as well
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 15:11): Geez on the walk back, so many hotties on 5th ave
Nate (2013-10-08 15:11): You too Jimmy + dudes
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 15:11): I'm not a dude?
Nate (2013-10-08 15:12): Wait, you're not a girl?  Damn, and your hot too.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 15:12): My hot too what?
Nate (2013-10-08 15:13) (2x <3): I was gonna keep going, but I feel like keeping my gay in gaylife...
Mark (2013-10-08 15:14) (1x <3): imo, it has to do with making her feel slutty. You have to decide during the date if you are going to fuck her or not. If not, then keep the makeout restrained and civilized. Otherwise, you won't see her again most likely even if the date went super well
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:14) (1x <3): you're hot too*
Mark (2013-10-08 15:15) (1x <3): it's beyond frustrating
Xander (2013-10-08 15:15): @Mark I'll keep that in mind. Two of these were from dates, and another was from meeting her at 13th Step
Nate (2013-10-08 15:15): @Mark that's not always true.  They have to feel like they are comfortable with you, even if you escalate a lot.  Best way to do that is to have some point where you open up to something really personal.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:16): @Nate But I have been doing that...
Nate (2013-10-08 15:16): @Xander do they do the same though?
Xander (2013-10-08 15:17): Yeah
Xander (2013-10-08 15:17): I can't really explain it. I think that these girls are actually insane
Nate (2013-10-08 15:17): Well that's also true
Xander (2013-10-08 15:17): They don't fucking know a good thing when they see it any more
Xander (2013-10-08 15:17): Thanks modern culture
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 15:18) (1x <3): Hey who's the one w/ the 631 area code?
Mark (2013-10-08 15:18) (1x <3): Nate, i feel that the comfort is there. What I'm describing is a 180 degree turn from awesome date to cold shoulder
Mark (2013-10-08 15:18) (1x <3): which is why Xander's gripe resonated with me
Xander (2013-10-08 15:18): Yes, same here
Xander (2013-10-08 15:18): I'm just a pretty face...
Mark (2013-10-08 15:18) (1x <3): my more experience PUA friend attributed it to slut shaming
Nate (2013-10-08 15:19): @Mark are you sure you're spending time qualifying them?
Nate (2013-10-08 15:19): Also not sure if night game hookups are any different.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:20) (1x <3): @jimmy I have a 631 area code
Mark (2013-10-08 15:20) (1x <3): pretty sure, because they'll say things like "you really get me", "i feel really comfortable around you for some reason", etc
Xander (2013-10-08 15:20): I mean, I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm usually doing everything right on these dates
Xander (2013-10-08 15:20): So there are other factors at play outside of my control
Nate (2013-10-08 15:21): Not sure then
Xander (2013-10-08 15:21) (2x <3): Maybe the girl on Friday date didn't like that my left ear was crusty and oozing poison ivy juice. Who knows?
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:22): "PHIL:
yes
send me a sexy pic
haha
then I'll send you one
NICOLE:
I'm not sexy
you are at work wtf haha you can't send sexy pics now"
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:22): lolll
Mark (2013-10-08 15:23) (3x <3): did you ask her to drink out of it like a hummingbird?
Xander (2013-10-08 15:24): I think that I also tend to accidentally select for shy girls.
Xander (2013-10-08 15:25) (1x <3): I subconsciously avoid bitchy girls, but those girls would probably be easier once I breach their shield
Mark (2013-10-08 15:26) (1x <3): yeah i find this kind of thing happens more with intelligent, classy broads, girls with dignity who fall into the traditional 3-day-lay mold
Mark (2013-10-08 15:27): 3-date-lay rather
Xander (2013-10-08 15:30): I'm serious about icing a bunch of my numbers
Xander (2013-10-08 15:31) (1x <3): I'm just not going to contact them any more. It's pathetic to chase more than a certain amount
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:32): I guess
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:32): you don't have to 'chase' them
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:32): but if there's a shot there's not point in cutting them off
Xander (2013-10-08 15:33): Fuck it, Phil. FUCK IT
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:33): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:33): you're in a weird mood
Xander (2013-10-08 15:33): Yes there is, because it doesn't matter. There are a million women in this city. I'm not going to waste my time reinforcing a girl's delusion that she's a beautiful snowflake
Xander (2013-10-08 15:33) (1x <3): I'll move on to the next 100 bitties
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 15:34): lol
Mark (2013-10-08 15:37) (1x <3): the cure is to go approach 50 women
Xander (2013-10-08 15:40) (1x <3): Seriously, do you even approach, bro?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:20): Dammit I love whiteboards
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:20): They're REMARKABLE
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:20): HA
Mark (2013-10-08 16:23): paging lame pun coon
Mark (2013-10-08 16:24): id make one but my corporate firewall is draconian
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:26): At first I was all
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:26) (1x <3): http://replygif.net/i/454.gif
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:26): But then I was all
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:26) (1x <3): http://replygif.net/i/727.gif
Mark (2013-10-08 16:28) (1x <3): that gif makes me want korean fried chicken
Xander (2013-10-08 16:30): So, I guess I'm headed out tonight.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:31): Solas?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:31): Lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:35): everybody come to solas
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:35): impromptu meetup
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:35): at 8
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:38): And then circle Kitty Sun like a bunch of sharks
Mark (2013-10-08 16:39): i have a feeling shes a bushbaby
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 16:42) (1x <3): http://i.imgur.com/JalXHwf.jpg
Xander (2013-10-08 16:50): I'm totally gonna stop by there
Xander (2013-10-08 16:51): But first I have to meet up with Schmitty and throw down some cash for our new pad
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:52): wait for real
Xander (2013-10-08 16:53): Yep
Nate (2013-10-08 16:53) (1x <3): Dude she's gonna recognize you.  I wanted to avoid that.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:53): oh yeah
Xander (2013-10-08 16:53): I'm joking about Solas
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:53): kinda forgot about that
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:53): lol
Nate (2013-10-08 16:54): :)
Xander (2013-10-08 16:54) (2x <3): I'll wave to her from outside your window after you get the bang
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:54): yay texting portia
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:55): she's too cute

Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:57): there's nicole
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:57) (2x <3): it took so much finagling to get that pic so enjoy it
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:58): she's so damn modest and shy
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 16:58): I'm gonna keep trying to get more and more sexy pictures I figure that's a good way to keep the rapport going over distances
Nate (2013-10-08 16:59) (1x <3): the girl from Sunday (Carla) said something awesome right after we had sex.  She said "You make me feel beautiful"
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:07): I like that
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:07): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/9d6d1540128b0131a2e37e3f9bfbe481

Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:09): we already have that
Mark (2013-10-08 17:09) (2x <3): SRU must die
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:09): hahaha
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:10): @Xander you're actually going to live with schmitty
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:10): ?
Xander (2013-10-08 17:13): @Philly Phil Most likely
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:13): what's the address
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:14): is it actually in the same complex as mine
Xander (2013-10-08 17:14): He won't fucking tell me for some reason
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:14): weirddooooo
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:14): he wouldn't tell me either
Xander (2013-10-08 17:14): "Let's meet at 13th and 1st"
Mark (2013-10-08 17:14) (2x <3): 135 rape alley
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:14): what time are you meeting
Xander (2013-10-08 17:14): 7
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:16) (1x <3): sweet see you there
Mark A (2013-10-08 17:16): He offered it to me too
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:16): lol
Xander (2013-10-08 17:16): Yeah, I gave him your number Mark
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:16): oh yea you taking it mark?
Mark A (2013-10-08 17:16): Yeah I thought so
Xander (2013-10-08 17:16): I couldn't remember what your lease situation was like
Nate (2013-10-08 17:19): Funny I don't think any of us have ever hinted that this chat exists.
Xander (2013-10-08 17:20): Schmitty said he had to "coach" at 5:30 in Madison Square Park
Xander (2013-10-08 17:22) (1x <3): @Nate Maybe they are picking up on the fact that some of us are dropping off of the face of the Earth
Mark (2013-10-08 17:25): schmitty offered to coach me as well, but i wasn't convinced from the little i saw
Xander (2013-10-08 17:27): I mean, is he actually better than any of us?
Nate (2013-10-08 17:28): I've never hung out with him at least knowingly
Mark (2013-10-08 17:28) (1x <3): he told me he's only been coaching for a month or so. if i'm going to spend $ on that kind of thing, i want someone more experienced
Nate (2013-10-08 17:29) (2x <3): Also being good with girls does not automatically mean someone can impart that knowledge
Xander (2013-10-08 17:29): Meh... I'll get coaching when I have completely plateaued and have the money
Xander (2013-10-08 17:29): And it will be from someone who is ridiculously experienced
Nate (2013-10-08 17:31): Nick Hoss is awesome, but he charges ALOT
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:34): I think schmitty is good
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:34): but he's not good enough to couch me
Xander (2013-10-08 17:35): No one is good enough to coach me, let alone have the honor of touching my johnson
Nate (2013-10-08 17:35) (2x <3): I've gotten more valuable insight/experience hanging out with you guys recently that coaching can't really improve on.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:36) (1x <3): wooordddd brother nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:36) (1x <3): that's why we have to keep this chat small
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:36): otherwise it won't be as useful
Nate (2013-10-08 17:36): I agree
Nate (2013-10-08 17:37) (2x <3): This chat should not become the noise that is the other one
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:37): yah
Xander (2013-10-08 17:38): Don't add to the din
Mark (2013-10-08 17:38) (1x <3): i think the main benefit of "coaching" is not the coaching per se, but having someone record your interactions because there are a lot of unconscious things you might be doing that you're not aware of
Xander (2013-10-08 17:38): Yeah, but any of us could do that...
Mark (2013-10-08 17:38): exactly
Xander (2013-10-08 17:38): And fo FREE
Nate (2013-10-08 17:39) (1x <3): We could get a camera/recording equipment and just help each other out
Nate (2013-10-08 17:39): Or hell just watch each other
Nate (2013-10-08 17:40) (1x <3): One thing about this chat is we are all strong, but in different areas
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:41): hm yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:41): not sure exactly what my speciality is
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:41): but w/e
Mark (2013-10-08 17:42) (3x <3): you can be the pink power ranger
Mark (2013-10-08 17:42) (1x <3): job is to look pretty
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:42): lol oh yeah that's me
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:42): I'm the pretty one
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:44): That would be pretty helpful
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:44) (2x <3): I think everybody here's seen me in set
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:44): Approaching, conversing, dancing
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:45) (1x <3): It would be awesome to hear some observations
Nate (2013-10-08 17:45): Well this isn't exactly an observation with you, but watching you in set really motivated me to improve my conversation teasing and such.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:46): well the one time I saw you in set was at brass monkey
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:47) (1x <3): and I guess it felt like to me that you were a bit overly exuberant for your mood
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:47): if you know what I mean
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:48): but that could have been that set or w/e
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:48): I havent see too much
Nate (2013-10-08 17:48): It's a little hard to give commentary so far after the fact too
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:48): oh yea lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:48) (1x <3): I've learned I do better if I'm not excited at all when I talk to girls
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:49): because I"m usually not excited to talk to them
Xander (2013-10-08 17:49): Yeah, calm the fuck down
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:49): lmao
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:50): you did pretty well talking to that asian though at 230 5th and the blond there too whatever her fucking name was
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:51): very good rapport touching good frame
Xander (2013-10-08 17:51) (2x <3): "The point of approaching is fucking. Not more approaching." lol, Chateau Heartiste wisdom today
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:51): I like that a lot that's why I never approach that many girls
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:51): that and I don't usually have to
Nate (2013-10-08 17:51): > I feel like I'll go back to gaming when I stop spending all my free time trying to improve my game
Nate (2013-10-08 17:51): Sandeep wisdom
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:52): um what
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:52): that doesn't make any sense
Nate (2013-10-08 17:52): Nope, not at all
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:52): Think he's talking about video games
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:52): Or PC games or whatever it is that virgins play these days
Nate (2013-10-08 17:52): oh, lol
Xander (2013-10-08 17:53): Hahaha
Nate (2013-10-08 17:53): I thought he was talking about being a keyboard jockey
Xander (2013-10-08 17:53): Sandeep... beta or omega?
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:53) (1x <3): he's just barely beta
Xander (2013-10-08 17:53): Lesser beta.
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:53): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:54): Bella
Nate (2013-10-08 17:54) (1x <3): He wants to skip straight from seeing a girl to approach to being in bed with her.  I can't talk to him anymore, listening to that is irritating.
Xander (2013-10-08 17:55) (2x <3): And contro is too busy focusing on his raging boner to actually get a girl to touch it
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:57): ugh
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:57) (1x <3): Xan man its gonna be sick being neighbors
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:57): oh also you'll get to fuck emily every day
Xander (2013-10-08 17:57) (1x <3): Seriously. I'm just scared about Emily. She knows...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 17:57) (3x <3): You two practically live together already
Philly Phil (2013-10-08 17:57): lol
Nate (2013-10-08 17:58) (2x <3): Non pickup related.  Anyone interested in having a poker night?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 18:00): That is so early 2000s man
Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 18:00): You're two thousand and LATE
Nate (2013-10-08 18:00): That's what she said
Nate (2013-10-08 18:00): okay

Jimmyayo (2013-10-08 18:35) (1x <3): “There is no growth in the comfort zone, and no comfort in the growth zone.”

Nate (2013-10-09 00:17): I spent enough time in bed with her to count it as having sex, and then let her talk for a few minutes, and kicked her out :)
Nate (2013-10-09 00:19) (1x <3): She did swallow like a pro tho
Nate (2013-10-09 00:20): I am amazed how far I've come though.

Xander (2013-10-09 10:38): Yeah, she was awkward when you introduced her to me as well
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 10:39): she said you looked like you were judging her
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 10:40) (1x <3): She's a girl...obv she's getting judged
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 10:41) (1x <3): yeah I told her oh yeah he was totally fucking judging you
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 10:43): So she had bad social skills huh?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 10:43) (1x <3): Why do most girls have bad social skills.  It's so annoying
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 10:44): Sometimes I really hate our generation

Philly Phil (2013-10-09 10:45): she didn't have bad social skills @jimmy she was a bit shy
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 10:46) (1x <3): but pretty chill she said she doesn't mind having a fuck buddy but she has to hate them somehow
Xander (2013-10-09 10:46): lol

Mark (2013-10-09 10:47): did you sign the lease Xander
Xander (2013-10-09 10:50): @Mark Yes
Xander (2013-10-09 10:51): I still need to find a guarantor, though, which is what I'm scrambling to do today
Xander (2013-10-09 10:51): This is gonna be a lean month...
Mark (2013-10-09 10:53): you still need a guarantor if theres like 5 guys on the lease?
Xander (2013-10-09 10:54): Apparently. It's kind of bullshit

Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:09): yep
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:09): came close to having sex with me but we didn't
Nate (2013-10-09 11:09) (2x <3): I barely had sex with mine, but I disliked being with her so much I got bored...
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:09): she cray tho

Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:11): hahaha oh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:11): With a name like Kitty, you'd think she'd be a bit more fun...
Nate (2013-10-09 11:11): No kidding.  I literally could not get her to move her body unless I moved it.
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:11): I used to get head from a girl named kitty in junior high school
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:11) (3x <3): "hahaha oh..."

-> that's what she said?
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:11): she was fucking nuts
Nate (2013-10-09 11:12): Yeah this one was not nuts, although it sounds like yours was
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:13): ya whateves
Xander (2013-10-09 11:13): http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html
Nate (2013-10-09 11:13): Mine was so inanimate that if I put her hand on my dick, she would just hold it there and I would have to move her hand myself.  Jeesh so bad.
Xander (2013-10-09 11:13) (1x <3): #feministswept
Nate (2013-10-09 11:14) (1x <3): @Phil I meant in a good way
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:14): oh haha I know
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:15): did you see me kiss her
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:15): I think I k closed like 5 minutes in
Xander (2013-10-09 11:15): @Philly Phil Was this a Tinder bitch?
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:15): yea
Nate (2013-10-09 11:15): No actually I didn't, although I was about 30 mins in when I did.
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:15): she was so receptive
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:16) (1x <3): it was easy to game her
Nate (2013-10-09 11:16): It's too bad the seat was taken next to me. That would have been fun :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:16): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:16): dude it was so weird talking to her
Xander (2013-10-09 11:17): Cali accent, I recognized it immediately
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:20): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:20) (2x <3): every other word was like "JAH!!"
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:20): omg it was pretty annoying
Xander (2013-10-09 11:20): lol, so fucking retarded
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:20): but I got used to it
Xander (2013-10-09 11:20): Reminds me of why I left
Mark (2013-10-09 11:21): i hope she didnt say 'hella' every other word
Mark (2013-10-09 11:21): shit is a boner killer
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:21): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:21): haha lots of 'JAH!' and 'like'
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:21): whatever
Nate (2013-10-09 11:21): like totallly
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:22): that too ^
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:22) (1x <3): I thought she was a fucking retard at first just because of how she talked but she was pretty smart
Xander (2013-10-09 11:23) (2x <3): Nah, she's a woman, so still retarded
Nate (2013-10-09 11:23): Hmm, I need to call some girls, I have nothing scheduled until Saturday
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:24): I got shit today and tomorrow
Nate (2013-10-09 11:24) (2x <3): Should be able to get something tomorrow if I try.
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:24): nothing friday yet
Nate (2013-10-09 11:24): Don't want to tonight, so I didn't schedule anything.
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:25): I'm excited for the girl tonight mostly cause she's so freaking hot
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:26): its so much more fun making out with a hot chick
Nate (2013-10-09 11:26): Oh definitely
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:26): I can actually get turned on
Nate (2013-10-09 11:26): Doesn't hurt if they have a tasty mouth too.  BLECK.  I brushed my teeth 3 times and I think I still taste it.
Xander (2013-10-09 11:26): They really are on to us... ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/288c35b013250131cfb82eedb1721be2
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:27): kitty had a nasty ass mouth?
Nate (2013-10-09 11:27): Just tell him it wasn't active enough to keep alive.
Nate (2013-10-09 11:27): Yeah
Nate (2013-10-09 11:27): Why do you think I kept asking for gum
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:27): oh yeah lol
Nate (2013-10-09 11:27): The one night I forget to bring mints...
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:28): haha its funny I came over and was like chew on some mint
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:28): or whatever the fuck I said
Nate (2013-10-09 11:28): I tried that :)
Nate (2013-10-09 11:28): After you said it
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:28): nice haha
Xander (2013-10-09 11:29): http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-founder-tirade-about-san-francisco-2013-8
Xander (2013-10-09 11:30): Reasons to hate San Francisco:
Xander (2013-10-09 11:30) (1x <3): The 49ers, but not the football team. "I'm referring to all the girls who are obviously 4's and behave like they are 9's," he writes. "Just because San Francisco has the worst Female to Male ratio in the known universe doesn't give you the right to be a b*tch all the time."
Xander (2013-10-09 11:31): I don't regret moving in the slightest.
Mark (2013-10-09 11:35): lol
Mark (2013-10-09 11:36): call me an elitist, but its either NY or London for me
Mark (2013-10-09 11:36): also for work reasons
Nate (2013-10-09 11:37): I wouldn't mind living in Munich or Southern France either
Xander (2013-10-09 11:39) (2x <3): I feel like gender ratio in Manhattan is insanely tilted in our favor
Nate (2013-10-09 11:39): We're not hurting for options
Mark (2013-10-09 11:43) (1x <3): i think the thing about NY/London is not necessarily the ratio, but rather that there are so many gorgeous women walking around from all over the world
Mark (2013-10-09 11:43): the women here have a better sense of where they are on the totem pole
Xander (2013-10-09 11:43): Even the models are a dime a dozen
Mark (2013-10-09 11:44) (1x <3): whereas in Philly, if you don't have an unibrow, you think you're a 9
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:45): love it
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:45): I should go to philly to up my game
Mark (2013-10-09 11:47): are you from Philly, or is that just your rapper name
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:47): that's my rapper name
Nate (2013-10-09 11:47) (1x <3): his real name is Uncle Phil
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:47): I'm a G dog
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:47): whoop whoop
Xander (2013-10-09 11:49): You can't spell "therapist" without "rapist"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:54): Hey guys
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:55): What language/tech do u program in?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:55): Are you guys all web devs?
Nate (2013-10-09 11:56): Javascript/Java
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 11:56): i'm a javascript guru
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:57): @Philly really?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:57): My jscript sucks ass
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:57): Gonna spend the weekend tightening it up, try to do a small home project
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:58): Backend dev is so much more fun (for me)
Xander (2013-10-09 11:58): Java (Android), Python
Nate (2013-10-09 11:58): I do backend in javascript at work
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 11:59): Do you enjoy coding in javascript?
Nate (2013-10-09 12:00): It's not bad.  At first I found it annoying when I started, but you have to stop trying to think in terms of classes and inheritence.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:00): Coming from static typed programming...i really don't enjoy javascript but it might be because i suck
Xander (2013-10-09 12:00) (1x <3): I have grown to like Java
Xander (2013-10-09 12:00): And Python is obviously sick nasty
Nate (2013-10-09 12:00) (1x <3): Java is okay, as long as you have a good IDE.
Nate (2013-10-09 12:01): Java would be so much better if they had decent list and property support
Mark (2013-10-09 12:01) (1x <3): haha i have the opposite problem Jimmy... im trying to get used to static typed coming from dynamic
Xander (2013-10-09 12:01): I'm just glad I'm not programming in Objective C
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:01): O gawd
Xander (2013-10-09 12:02): I'm starting to learn Clojure
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:02): wait is everyone a programmer her
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:02): e
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:02): wtf
Xander (2013-10-09 12:02): Not Newport Mark
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:02): I dunno man...dynamic is cool cuz it's so flexible but shit, there is some really unpredictable behavior
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:02): ah yea
Xander (2013-10-09 12:02) (1x <3): Clojure is pretty awesome
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-09 12:02): Mark changed the group's name to Coders
Mark (2013-10-09 12:03): i agree, static is alot more robust and safe
Nate (2013-10-09 12:04): static has a better chance of giving you the problems at compile time instead of runtime.
Mark (2013-10-09 12:04) (1x <3): i think im just a lazy coder... all my languages are super concise: R, F#, python
Nate (2013-10-09 12:04): dynamic is quite a bit more concise tho
Xander (2013-10-09 12:05) (1x <3): Oh, Hot Tongs is an actuary, I believe
Nate (2013-10-09 12:05): Yeah, he know exactly how long you will live, down to the day.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:05): HAHA what a nerd
Xander (2013-10-09 12:06) (1x <3): So he found a way to represent true infinity, huh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:08): Ok and what about source control systems?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:08): Are you guys all Git nerds?
Nate (2013-10-09 12:08): We use git
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:09): yes
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:09): svn sucks ass
Mark (2013-10-09 12:09): subversion here
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:09): I love git and mercurial
Nate (2013-10-09 12:09): We use git + a whole bunch of  python scripts to handle deployments and keeping track of individual tickets.
Xander (2013-10-09 12:09): GIT
Xander (2013-10-09 12:09): I WUV IT
Xander (2013-10-09 12:10): USING GRADLE AND TRYING OUT BUCK TOO
Nate (2013-10-09 12:10): mercurial is nice too.  I think it's more straightforward
Xander (2013-10-09 12:10): AND JENKINS FOR OTHER STUFF
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:10): Ok so everybody's on some sort of dvcs, no TFS, VSS, Starteam bullshit
Nate (2013-10-09 12:10): svn is like driving a Model-T and I have a ferrari
Mark (2013-10-09 12:10) (1x <3): no one trusts each other in this industry, so svn is the standard
Nate (2013-10-09 12:11): @Jimmy yuck
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:12): Last Q: how do you keep up your chops w/ new tech, trends, frameworks, etc?
Xander (2013-10-09 12:12): Pillow talk with tech girls?
Mark (2013-10-09 12:12) (1x <3): gross
Nate (2013-10-09 12:12): @Xander's method
Nate (2013-10-09 12:12): Oh baby, tell me those Rails!
Xander (2013-10-09 12:12): Seriously, the fuckin' Adria Richards of the world
Mark (2013-10-09 12:12): all fun and games until their mustache rubs off on your cheek
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:12): I have such an unchallenging/cush job, I really need to motivate myself to keep on top of this shit
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:13): oh yeah same here ^
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:13): I only care in between jobs
Nate (2013-10-09 12:13): @Jimmy very little has changed in the field in the last few years
Xander (2013-10-09 12:13): So many women in tech who are just politic-ers, don't actually have any skills
Mark (2013-10-09 12:13): i think we all have pretty cushy jobs, hence this chat
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:13): lol
Nate (2013-10-09 12:13): Yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:13): there's no women in tech at my job
Xander (2013-10-09 12:13): LOL I'm poor as shit
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:13): And yesterday's 2hr lunch lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:13) (1x <3): out of 40 dudes
Nate (2013-10-09 12:14): I took the day off, just because I felt like it.  I still have more vacation left with less than 3 months than most people get all year
Xander (2013-10-09 12:14) (1x <3): @Philly Phil Must be the Patriarchy keeping women out of your company!
Nate (2013-10-09 12:15) (1x <3): We had a women coder when I started.  She was pretty good.  Then she left and we hired another one, who was so bad we fired her.  Now all our women are project managers
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:15): Nate
"@Jimmy very little has changed in the field in the last few years"

I dunno about that...maybe I've just been out of it for so long but esp. w/ javascript, there's so much new goodness
Nate (2013-10-09 12:16) (2x <3): Well non-relational databases have gotten all faddy too
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:16): Yah...there's some serious $ in that right now
Xander (2013-10-09 12:16): @Nate Did she take maternity leave?
Mark (2013-10-09 12:16) (1x <3): Jimmy, i would go on codeacademy from time to time and pick up a new language
Nate (2013-10-09 12:17): @Xander lol sexist.  She found another job.
Xander (2013-10-09 12:17): Yes, I am sexist, and proud of it.
Xander (2013-10-09 12:17): It's not my fault God made men superior.
Mark (2013-10-09 12:17): ruby, django, hadoop, etc those are pretty trendy i hear
Nate (2013-10-09 12:17): django is pretty neat
Xander (2013-10-09 12:17): Take it up with God, if you have a problem!
Nate (2013-10-09 12:17): I do not have a problem
Nate (2013-10-09 12:18): <that one was subtle>
Mark (2013-10-09 12:18): check this out
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:18): ugh
Mark (2013-10-09 12:18): http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends
Xander (2013-10-09 12:19): Disgusting...
Nate (2013-10-09 12:20): I wonder what I'll eat for lunch
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-09 12:20): Mark changed the group's name to Closers
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-09 12:21) (3x <3): Nate changed the group's name to Clojures
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:21): Hahaha

Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:22): lmao love it
Xander (2013-10-09 12:23): Who wants to build a MUD with me?
Nate (2013-10-09 12:23): lol
Mark (2013-10-09 12:25): only if we do it in assembly
Xander (2013-10-09 12:25): We could make a GBA game
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:25): MUD?
Xander (2013-10-09 12:25) (1x <3): @Jimmyayo Do you even code, bro?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:26): I'm a dinosaur man
Xander (2013-10-09 12:26): All the more reason you should know what a MUD is
Nate (2013-10-09 12:26): Jimmy is a Cobol developer
Nate (2013-10-09 12:27): <- Old guy knows
Jimmyayo (2013-10-09 12:27) (1x <3): I prefer AS400
Nate (2013-10-09 12:28): TRS-80 baby
Mark (2013-10-09 12:29): TI-83 for me
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-09 12:34) (3x <3): Mark changed the group's avatar
Xander (2013-10-09 12:36): @Jimmyayo http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD
Mark (2013-10-09 12:51) (1x <3): Kitty is texting me now, i think she feels emboldened after losing her virginity last night
Nate (2013-10-09 12:53): What is she saying?
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:56): um and she knows that you're nate's friend
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 12:56): that's kinda weird
Mark (2013-10-09 12:56): she just said 'hey'... i dont think im going to respond
Xander (2013-10-09 12:57): "I got 99 problems, but a glitch ain't one."
Xander (2013-10-09 12:58): She's texting me too...
Mark (2013-10-09 12:59): Nate, did you take pics btw
Nate (2013-10-09 12:59): Actually I didn't.  I totally forgot to. :(
Mark (2013-10-09 12:59) (1x <3): what is she, like 6ish?
Nate (2013-10-09 13:00): Yeah about
Nate (2013-10-09 13:00): She was more of a 7 lying in the dark naked on my bed.
Nate (2013-10-09 13:00): Lack of light helped
Nate (2013-10-09 13:01): She wasn't thrilled when I kicked her out.
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 13:04): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 13:04): I think she was about a 6
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 13:04): if she wasn't so awkward she might be closer to a 7
Nate (2013-10-09 13:05) (1x <3): If she dressed well and put on some makeup she'd look pretty good
Nate (2013-10-09 13:13): Damn I'm hungry
Mark (2013-10-09 13:15): what happened to your hair Nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 13:15): holy mother of god
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 13:15): I like that pic
Nate (2013-10-09 13:17): Spike is awesome
Nate (2013-10-09 13:18): @Mark I got it permed
Mark (2013-10-09 13:19): i thought spike was black
Nate (2013-10-09 13:19): lol no
Mark (2013-10-09 13:19): i always see him at knicks games
Nate (2013-10-09 13:20) (1x <3): Have you never seen Cowboy Bebop?
Mark (2013-10-09 13:21): is that the one where he dies at the end
Nate (2013-10-09 13:23): It's ambiguous
Xander (2013-10-09 13:46): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b6c349d01338013177b066a423bc71c4
Xander (2013-10-09 13:49): Looking forward to reading this over the weekend
Nate (2013-10-09 13:51): Looks like a very shiny cover
Xander (2013-10-09 14:00): I'm probably going to recommend that you buy this for every beta friend you feel like trying to save
Xander (2013-10-09 14:00): After I'm done reading
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:06): so my roommate jordan
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:06): I've been thinking about him and if he would be good at game
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:07): and I think he would be really good but in a very different way
Xander (2013-10-09 14:07): Yeah, I think he will be receptive to game when he's ready
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:07): well no that's not what I mean
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:07): I don't think he needs game
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:07): and he already knows all about it anyway
Xander (2013-10-09 14:08): Knowing about it and being able to execute it are two wildly different things
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:09): yea but I mean his attitude, self reflection, maturity, and self worth are off the charts
Xander (2013-10-09 14:09): True
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:09): he's very secure in himself
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:09): and super adult like
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:09): plus he's been dating a 30 y/o
Xander (2013-10-09 14:10): Ew
Xander (2013-10-09 14:10): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:10) (1x <3): lol she just turned 30
Xander (2013-10-09 14:10): Their breakup makes a lot more sense
Philly Phil (2013-10-09 14:10): yah
Xander (2013-10-09 14:10): With that knowledge

Xander (2013-10-09 15:03): Still would rather look at that than a fat chick
Xander (2013-10-09 15:03): Being a fat chick is like spitting in God's face
Nate (2013-10-09 15:04): I would post an image of a fat chick here to disgust you, but that would mean I would have to google fat chick images and I'm just not doing it.

Nate (2013-10-10 11:35) (1x <3): One of the girls from last week was afraid I would post the pics of us on facebook where her boyfriend could see.  She messaged me asking where they were (cause she still wants them).  I said I had them blown up and they are the new billboard in Time Square.
Philly Phil (2013-10-10 11:37): Lmao
Nate (2013-10-10 11:39): I used to take all this PUA stuff so seriously.  *Whine* must get girls! ...
Nate (2013-10-10 11:39): Now I'm just having so much fun with it.
Xander (2013-10-10 11:41) (2x <3): I basically just sat next to Phil and his girl last night and alternated between fucking around with Tinder/texting, and DHVing the shit out of Phil
Xander (2013-10-10 11:41): What a lazy night
Nate (2013-10-10 11:42): Did they make out in front of you? :)

Xander (2013-10-10 12:02): I see a lot of comments saying "I can't believe #fatshamingweek is a thing." Oh yeah? I can't believe FAT ACCEPTANCE is a thing.
Nate (2013-10-10 12:04): In old days fat were desired because it was a sign they had tons of money and power.
Nate (2013-10-10 12:04): MEN
Nate (2013-10-10 12:04) (1x <3): fat men
Nate (2013-10-10 12:06): These days fat is a symbol of lack of drive and self control.
Xander (2013-10-10 12:06): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/sexual-market-value-boosted-one-shed-pound-at-a-time/

Nate (2013-10-10 12:08) (2x <3): @Xander noone that matters says that
Nate (2013-10-10 12:08): Also known as ugly people
Xander (2013-10-10 12:09): Almost all feminists are fat/ugly, since pretty girls don't need feminism
Mark (2013-10-10 12:09): isnt all this shit obvious though

Philly Phil (2013-10-10 15:55): ...
Xander (2013-10-10 15:55): When you overqualify yourself, she thinks that you're out of your league/are a player

Philly Phil (2013-10-10 15:56): hmm yea

Philly Phil (2013-10-10 17:16): I like a little pain with my pleasure
Nate (2013-10-10 17:21): Girls aren't generally big fans of hot sauce in their pussy though

Nate (2013-10-10 17:35): I know

Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:23): just heard this joke
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:23): this must have some deeper meaning
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:23) (1x <3): "women only call me ugly until they find out how much money I'm making"
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:23) (1x <3): "...then they call me ugly and poor."
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:23): or you've been watching too much archer
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:23): lol I think that's it ^
Nate (2013-10-11 10:29) (2x <3): No such thing as too much Archer

Nate (2013-10-11 10:40): She knows if she kisses you inside its fuck city
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:41): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/13816c1014b10131f97c02027d965931
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:41): not sure how to respond to that

Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:41): you can use my bed I'll be out all day
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:41): what
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:41): oh for friday lol
Nate (2013-10-11 10:42): Totally bang her sorority
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:42): I already proposed hanging out then its a low key thing I think
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:42): How about letting it rest for a cpl days?
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:42): nah
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:42): I like her
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:43): haha I know you do
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:43): but (and this is in my humble opinion) too much pulling can decrease the attraction
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:43): this early on
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:43): yea .. hm
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:43): alright maybe i could see other girls
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:44): this sunday
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:44): She's a special girl to u huh?
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:44): I think she's pretty awesome
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:44): and hot, sexy and cute
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:45): basically exactly what I want
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:46): alright I guess I'll leave it be
Nate (2013-10-11 10:48): @Phil maybe you're giving that vibe off too much.  If she thinks your that invested she probably will hit the breaks because she knows you won't leave
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:49): so how would you respond to that text
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:50): This is the pickup paradox for me.  

You play this silly game of ours, use the 2:3 ratio/rule, enjoy abundance mentality, find a bunch of sluts to bang.  

But then you find the special one, the rare unicorn, and for once want to be genuine, not play the game...

and then you lose her
Nate (2013-10-11 10:53): Women are so stupid
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:54) (3x <3): Had a good talk w/ Mark last night at the bar about this phrase, "Give a woman the gift of chasing you" and it's so true...it is a gift
Nate (2013-10-11 10:56): When that girl called me last night, the one who was miss proper and poised, was giggling like a school girl while she talked to me.
Nate (2013-10-11 10:58): @phil maybe take the frame that you are so fun that she does need a rest to recover from you?  I dunno.  Or just don't reply at all?
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:58): I'm thinking of not replying
Xander (2013-10-11 10:58) (1x <3): @Philly Phil I'll take you up on that Sunday bed offer
Nate (2013-10-11 10:59): Ask Jesus for the best path
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 10:59): Let's await a response from text-master-xander
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:59): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 10:59): jesus please give me your guidance
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 11:00): Back in cali, my dad used to call our gardener "Jesus" like the son of god, his name was actually pronounced "hey-zoos"
Xander (2013-10-11 11:00): My son
Nate (2013-10-11 11:01) (1x <3): Hey-zoos is how Jesus is pronounced in spanish :)
Xander (2013-10-11 11:01) (2x <3): So I say to you, ask and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the poosy will be opened for you.
Nate (2013-10-11 11:02) (2x <3): I wonder if anyone in the other chat noticed last night when someone said "I need help"  I gave them the number for the suicide hotline.
Xander (2013-10-11 11:02): Is Liz the girl who was wearing green pants while I texted/Tindered right next to your date
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:03): yes
Xander (2013-10-11 11:03): I thought you were already going to hang out with her tonight
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:03): oh no I wasn't
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:03): we didn't set up another meet up
Xander (2013-10-11 11:03): So what's with the "let's hang out tomorrow night"
Xander (2013-10-11 11:03): Ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:03): yeah she said w/e
Xander (2013-10-11 11:04) (1x <3): So she was just telling us about that sorority thing to DHV herself
Xander (2013-10-11 11:06) (1x <3): "I'll let you know if we go out afterward"
Xander (2013-10-11 11:06): Yeah right, toots
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:09): Whateves
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:17) (1x <3): Okay I said let's be heathens together
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:17): Whatever
Xander (2013-10-11 11:17): Hahaha
Xander (2013-10-11 11:18): I'm gonna start copywriting my shit
Xander (2013-10-11 11:18): Btw Phil, I wouldn't have even responded yet
Xander (2013-10-11 11:18): I forgot to give you my text advice
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:19): ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:19): yeah I stole that form you
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:19): lol
Xander (2013-10-11 11:23) (1x <3): It's usually better to leave things hanging when she sends you a message rather than try to force a witty reply
Xander (2013-10-11 11:24): Once you have gleaned whatever info you were seeking from the interaction
Xander (2013-10-11 11:24): In this case, if she wanted to hang out tonight
Nate (2013-10-11 11:25) (2x <3): Her answer was "You're third priority right now" ...
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:25): hmm
Xander (2013-10-11 11:25): Yes
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:27): alright I also was thinking about texting portia to see if she wanted to hang out tonight
Xander (2013-10-11 11:28): @Philly Phil Why the fuck wouldn't you do that
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:29): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d3c87f5014b70131c5b25ad78334d528
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:29): we were supposed to hang out yesterday
Xander (2013-10-11 11:29) (2x <3): Alright, looks like I'm meeting Angel tonight, having sex all day with Emily on Saturday then meeting Colombian girl from Solas Julia on Sunday
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:29): that's why
Xander (2013-10-11 11:29) (1x <3): Would have just sent "you suck"
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:30): lol I know
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:30): I feel weird texting her again
Xander (2013-10-11 11:30): Offering another time makes it sound like you're waiting around to see if she wants to hang out with you
Nate (2013-10-11 11:30) (2x <3): Cooking dinner for Carla Saturday, and then meeting Mira Sunday
Xander (2013-10-11 11:31): @Philly Phil I mean, unless she has already shown that she's really into you, don't text her again
Xander (2013-10-11 11:31): At least not yet
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:32): I think she's shown that
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:32): pretty clearly
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:32): I haven't seen her in a week though
Xander (2013-10-11 11:32): You probably should have started talking about some random bullshit before asking to hang out
Xander (2013-10-11 11:32) (1x <3): As if it's almost an afterthought
Nate (2013-10-11 11:33) (1x <3): @Phil you're starting to sound like me in your texts, that's not a good thing...
Nate (2013-10-11 11:33) (1x <3): the old me
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:34): shit
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:34): I like these girls too much
Xander (2013-10-11 11:34) (2x <3): Exactly, and you're letting it show
Nate (2013-10-11 11:34) (2x <3): Yeah, and it's showing
Xander (2013-10-11 11:34): :-D
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:34): okay before I fuck this up I have to back off
Xander (2013-10-11 11:35): Si
Nate (2013-10-11 11:35) (2x <3): This is what you sound like "Pretty please find a time to see me, I'll wait here until you do."
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:35): shiittt
Xander (2013-10-11 11:35) (1x <3): Yes Nate, that's what I was getting at
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:36): damn I hate texting I'm so much better in person
Nate (2013-10-11 11:36): Yeah me too
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:36): okay I'm gonna leave portia alone
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:36): and liz for now
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:36): my two favs
Xander (2013-10-11 11:37) (1x <3): If I could bottle up my text game and give it to you in potion form Phil, I would
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:38): I was doing well for awhile
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:38) (1x <3): I'm just a bit too invested right now
Xander (2013-10-11 11:38) (1x <3): When I was right there making sure you didn't send anything stupid!
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:38): loll nah
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:38): I had some pretty good interactions
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:38): specially on tinder
Xander (2013-10-11 11:39): Your early text game has improved significantly
Xander (2013-10-11 11:39) (1x <3): It's the mid to long texting you need to work on most
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:40): gotcha
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:40): whats some of that text lit you were reading
Xander (2013-10-11 11:41): I'll link you to the most important pieces in a little bit
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:41): sweeet
Xander (2013-10-11 11:41): I'm about to heat up some leftovers at work
Nate (2013-10-11 11:41): Me too, my text game is still pretty special ed
Xander (2013-10-11 11:42) (1x <3): @Philly Phil Basically, as you even admitted, the main issue is that your attachment to these girls is leaking through your mid-range texts
Xander (2013-10-11 11:43): What I mean is that if you correct your mindset (falling into frame of scarcity with these chicks you really dig) then your text game will automatically improve as a result
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:43) (1x <3): yeah it is.. I mean I know I like them probably the hottest/coolest girls I've met so far
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:43): gotcha
Xander (2013-10-11 11:44): However, because you can control every word in the texts, even if you DO feel a ton of attachment, you can mask it by sounding aloof and playful in the texts
Xander (2013-10-11 11:45) (1x <3): What I mean is that it also works the other way: correcting your texts can help improve your mindset, especially when you realize that it gets you better results
Xander (2013-10-11 11:45): Fake it til you make it, as it were
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:47): okay I'm not gonna fuck this shit up
Xander (2013-10-11 11:48) (1x <3): I'm double-fisting mugs of green tea at work cuz someone stole the french press
Nate (2013-10-11 11:49) (2x <3): @Phil and if you do, remember how easy it was to get this far.  You can always do it again.
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:49): right
Xander (2013-10-11 11:49) (2x <3): @Phil don't even worry about fucking it up, you're a scientist conducting experiments
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:49): and I still have 5 other active women
Xander (2013-10-11 11:56): Every time I'm feeling a little down, I check out this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:58) (1x <3): The Sixteen Commandments Of Poon
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:58): I've been rereading this every day
Xander (2013-10-11 11:58): Better than the Bible
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:58): oh Jordan went to some party last night and was talking and flirting with a 9.5
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:59): he's ridiculous
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 11:59) (2x <3): he was like idk how it happened I didn't even want to flirt with her
Xander (2013-10-11 12:05): So glad my boss's omega roommate is at comic con today. His constant foot shuffling and non sequitur comments are fucking distracting
Nate (2013-10-11 12:06): You have the world's wierdest work situation
Xander (2013-10-11 12:06): Seriously. We've been looking at office spaces
Xander (2013-10-11 12:07): It wasn't a problem before, but he got laid off from his wage slave programming job so now he hangs out at the apartment and harasses us all day
Nate (2013-10-11 12:08): I suppose you can't tell him to fuck off
Xander (2013-10-11 12:08): I get pretty close
Xander (2013-10-11 12:09) (1x <3): Also, trashing omegas is kinda needlessly cruel, since they're already so fucked
Xander (2013-10-11 12:11) (1x <3): I am still seriously trying to get him to lose his virginity for his 38th birthday. My boss knows some good gals in the escort industry
Nate (2013-10-11 12:18): What he really needs is sex therapy
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:19): I'm too self centered to give a shit
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:19): about a guy like that
Xander (2013-10-11 12:21) (1x <3): Yeah, but you haven't been forced to be around him for months. It's more for my selfish benefit if he at least upgrades from omega to lesser beta
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:21): If I know a guy like that, try to help out a little, but only if he's willing to accept help and put forth some effort
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:22): yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:22): Can't help a guy that doesn't want it
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:22): my last job had a guy like that
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:22): he wasn't as omega as Xander's project
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:22): but really bad
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:22): and a fat fuck who wouldn't take help from me
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:23): he was whipped to shit by his ugly girlfriend who he was constantly thinking about breaking up with but wouldn't
Nate (2013-10-11 12:24): There was a guy like that in college.  He was pretty good looking, but had the ugliest nastiest women on the planet because he had no self esteem.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:24) (3x <3): #depressingfriday
Xander (2013-10-11 12:24): I just thought of my new Tinder tagline:
Xander (2013-10-11 12:24): "I usually Tinder when I'm on the john"
Xander (2013-10-11 12:25): It's funny cuz it's true
Nate (2013-10-11 12:26): God I hate IE, spending all morning dealing with IE being a little bitch
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:26): IE6 is all the rage tho
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:27): ah man so glad I don't have to worry about anything lower than IE9 anymore
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:27): I used to code for IE6
Nate (2013-10-11 12:27): No kidding rage
Nate (2013-10-11 12:27): Trying to get something working in IE8, where I can't even inspect properly
Xander (2013-10-11 12:28) (3x <3): I like how Chrome just let's you hot-code changes in website html/css
Nate (2013-10-11 12:28) (1x <3): Yeah I use chrome except to fix ie bugs
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:29): yeah I'm a chrome fan
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:29) (1x <3): I have so many awesome plugins that help me code
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:31) (2x <3): jsbeautify, what font, gridfy
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:31) (1x <3): if you're looking for some sweet plugins
Xander (2013-10-11 12:32): Duly noted, Phil. Thanks
Xander (2013-10-11 12:33): http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h6njs/what_are_some_obvious_and_notsoobvious_ways_a/carfklf
Xander (2013-10-11 12:34): Judging by the downvotes, it looks like common sense is in short supply these days
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:35): lol I upvoted that shit
Xander (2013-10-11 12:35): Haha, me too
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:37): I commented too
Nate (2013-10-11 12:37): Wow, the comments on that post are dumb as fuck
Xander (2013-10-11 12:42): I kinda want to adjust my Tinder for just 30-40 y/o for a while
Xander (2013-10-11 12:42): Get some thirsty cougars
Nate (2013-10-11 12:43): Game on easy mode
Xander (2013-10-11 12:43): Seriously. Let's just make it even easier
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:47) (2x <3): I took a monster shit and now I'm so hungry
Xander (2013-10-11 12:47): I have hankering for some poosy
Nate (2013-10-11 12:48) (1x <3): I want ramen
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:50): Engaged chick is sending me pictures of her outfit...wtf
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:50): What a slut
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:51): ah god never send that attractive comment thing to a feminist
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:51): so annoying
Xander (2013-10-11 12:51): @Philly Phil Did you just try to>
Xander (2013-10-11 12:51): ?
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:52): lol yes
Xander (2013-10-11 12:52): wtf haha

Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:54): MARCELLE:
Have long hair, be skinny, be hot, blond whatever
PHIL:
yea so
long hair is attractive
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:54): MARCELLE:
Be you, and interesting people will appear, dress like you like, the way you feel attractive, and then the right people will be attractive to you
And I've dated men that went crazy for my short hair, loving the fact that my neck was showing...
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:54): So it's personal
Try being attractive dressing and acting on a way you don't actually feel attractive
If I feel hotter wearing pants, but put on a dress just because the list says it's more attractive do you think it works?
Attractive comes also from how you feel about you actually
PHIL:
its a general list
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:54): lol
Xander (2013-10-11 12:54): Just be yourself, Phil!
Xander (2013-10-11 12:55): Stop being a woman-hating misogynist pig
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:55): lol I just want to fuck with her now
Xander (2013-10-11 12:56): You should have just said, "Yes." in response to the wearing pants vs dress comment
Xander (2013-10-11 12:56): High heels may be painful, but they look sexy, hun
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 12:57) (2x <3): 100% hun
Xander (2013-10-11 12:58) (1x <3): I could not stop saying "such a pleasure" last night
Xander (2013-10-11 12:59) (1x <3): You can wear whatever you want, but you don't get to decided what I find attractive
Xander (2013-10-11 12:59): *decide
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 12:59): "such a pleasure" in response to what, xander?
Xander (2013-10-11 13:00): Exchanging names, whilst shaking their hand
Xander (2013-10-11 13:00): "Xander, such a pleasure"
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:00): sometimes I just say pleasure
Xander (2013-10-11 13:00): Haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:00): "Phil, pleasure"
Xander (2013-10-11 13:01): Phil "Pleasure" Leesha
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:01): lol
Xander (2013-10-11 13:02): Being on Tinder really highlights the solipsism inherent in females
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:11): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/251da6b014c60131edb8123976e1de9b
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:12): I don't want him stealing my lines
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:12): not that he ever gets any matches
Xander (2013-10-11 13:15): Why the hell are you writing real things in the main chat
Xander (2013-10-11 13:15): They're going to ruin everything!
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:16): I know
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:16): I souldn't
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:16): shouldn't* lol
Xander (2013-10-11 13:23): http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/416/699/9c6.png
Mark A (2013-10-11 13:50): Ok so we need a groupme chat just for events no chatting
Mark A (2013-10-11 13:50): https://m.facebook.com/events/295724517232620/
Xander (2013-10-11 13:51): We all have each other's phone numbers. Figure we can just text for important things
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:52): idk I figure this chat is smal
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:52): so we can talk about whatever
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 13:52): and it won't get cluttered
Nate (2013-10-11 13:53) (2x <3): Well there are few enough of us here that we just say "Hey I'm going out, come join me"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 13:59): I've thought about this too
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 13:59): So I'm sure we all have notifications off
Xander (2013-10-11 13:59): Yep
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:00): So if ur out and want to send the bat signal, u say so here in the chat
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:00): But then u have to manually check it every cpl min
Xander (2013-10-11 14:00): Wish there was a way we could make it notify with the correct hashtag, like #BatSignal
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:01): But if someone 'likes' ur post, ur phone has a visual alert
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:01): Mine blinks
Xander (2013-10-11 14:01): Yeah, I get notified for the likes as well
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:02): So then I know someone read and acknowledged my bat signal and can open the app and see what's going on, who wants to come, etc
Nate (2013-10-11 14:02) (1x <3): I just text people if I really want to find them
Xander (2013-10-11 14:02): @Nate like I said before
Xander (2013-10-11 14:02): I need to put ya'll on some kind of speed-text
Nate (2013-10-11 14:03): Yeah I stole your line Xander
Jimmyayo (2013-10-11 14:03): Can't u? On ur phone?
Mark A (2013-10-11 14:03): No no. I mean events, like edm events, parties, etc
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:04) (1x <3): I'd rather just go to a bar
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:04): honestly
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:04): I tried the whole edm event party thing
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:04): its not my scene
Xander (2013-10-11 14:04): Same here
Xander (2013-10-11 14:04) (2x <3): Honestly, I'm also trying to transition more to day game in general, too
Xander (2013-10-11 14:04) (2x <3): These late nights are beginning to wear on my soul
Nate (2013-10-11 14:06): Why I started with day game
Xander (2013-10-11 14:07) (1x <3): @Mark A is still obsessed with getting 8s and 9s in clubs
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:09): you seem angry in the other chat xanda
Philly Phil (2013-10-11 14:09) (2x <3): its getting me hot
Xander (2013-10-11 14:09): Time for some tough love, mothafuckas!
Nate (2013-10-11 14:09): Those bitches have been whining for a while.  Time they stopped it and started doing shit, or gtfo
Xander (2013-10-11 14:10): Seriously. How can they spend so much time in there bullshitting
Xander (2013-10-11 14:11): I'm mostly only on here during work hours, unbeknownst to my boss
Nate (2013-10-11 14:11): Same

Philly Phil (2013-10-14 10:24): lol
Xander (2013-10-14 10:26): Morning
Xander (2013-10-14 10:49) (2x <3): My dick is raw
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 10:57): lol
Nate (2013-10-14 10:58) (1x <3): #puaproblems
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:00): Morning!
Xander (2013-10-14 11:01): Man, SRU had a hard time approaching last night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:02): really?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:02): unlike him...
Nate (2013-10-14 11:02): yeah
Nate (2013-10-14 11:02): When I've seen him he's approached as much as me
Nate (2013-10-14 11:02): Although like me he's more daygame, so that could be it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:03): this was at times sq?
Xander (2013-10-14 11:03): @Jimmyayo Yes
Nate (2013-10-14 11:03) (1x <3): Maybe you made him nervous
Xander (2013-10-14 11:03): He seems to not be in a great place
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:03): hmm
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:03): that sucks
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:03): my opinion of him is that he's too invested
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:04): in the game
Nate (2013-10-14 11:04): I don't see him talking about successes much, which I think means he's not getting many
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:04) (2x <3): he wants out too badly
Xander (2013-10-14 11:04): He had a mere 5 approach quota to do but he could only do four in the time I was with him for over an hour
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:05): yeah hm for me I want out as well but I mean I'm still having an awesome time
Nate (2013-10-14 11:05) (2x <3): On the other side Hot Tongs was approaching like a machine yesterday.
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:05) (2x <3): hot tongsssss!!!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:06): Hahaha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:06): So it was you four out yesterday?
Xander (2013-10-14 11:06): Wish I could have run game with you guys yesterday!
Nate (2013-10-14 11:06): Yeah it was a fun time
Xander (2013-10-14 11:07): I ended up going to Piano's after meeting SRU to hang out with Newport Mark and Ltd
Xander (2013-10-14 11:07): My curse continues... Got blatant IOIs from girls who had boyfriends
Xander (2013-10-14 11:08): Who would then continue to gawk at me after giving me their boyfriend rejection talk
Nate (2013-10-14 11:09) (1x <3): @Xander tell them you'll hang out as friends.  Learned that from Jimmy.  One of my double booked dates for thursday is with one of those.
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:09): not a bad idea ^
Xander (2013-10-14 11:10): Good idea
Mark A (2013-10-14 11:15): "I'm only looking for friendship, when r u free for coffee"
Nate (2013-10-14 11:15): I say "Let's hang out as friends then"
Nate (2013-10-14 11:15) (3x <3): Once you're on the date though, it doesn't matter anyway
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 11:20) (1x <3): It's not going to work 100% of the time obviously, and that should be okay.  If she's a really cool gal and is attached to her bf, you probably want to have her as a friend anyway
Nate (2013-10-14 11:23) (1x <3): And my brazilian date for tonight confirmed.  Looking majorly forward to this one.
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:24): me too ^
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 11:24) (1x <3): I just polished all my binoculars
Nate (2013-10-14 11:24): haha
Nate (2013-10-14 11:25) (1x <3): She seems pretty excited too, her response to "See you at 8pm" was "Perfect!"

Nate (2013-10-14 12:08): "short shorts"
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 12:08): right
Mark A (2013-10-14 12:09): Take a picture if urself wearing short shorts
Mark A (2013-10-14 12:09): And send it

Philly Phil (2013-10-14 15:38): you have a picture nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 15:38): I'd love to see her
Nate (2013-10-14 15:38): I've posted it here before, but it's a pretty bad pic of her.  She looks older in it than she does in person.
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 15:38): ah yeah

Xander (2013-10-14 15:51): I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing with myself after work
Nate (2013-10-14 15:51): day game
Xander (2013-10-14 15:51) (1x <3): I might have to do laundry, since I'm out of everything.
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 15:52): I get my laundry done for me
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 15:52): cause I'm a fancy motherfucker
Nate (2013-10-14 15:53) (1x <3): I number closed my neighbor doing laundry.  She put Laura Croft's body to shame.
Xander (2013-10-14 15:53): But that's...impossible...

Xander (2013-10-14 16:23): I don't like the first one that much
Xander (2013-10-14 16:23): She looks like a muppet
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 16:23): she might be cuter in person

Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:17) (1x <3): By living in NYC for 10 years =\
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:17): And going out a lot
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:18): The stanton social is a pretty high end restaurant/club, so to be able to drink for free there is huge, IMO
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:18): It's every monday night btw
Xander (2013-10-14 18:18): Really
Xander (2013-10-14 18:18): And I just show up

Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:19): Yeah.  You might want to look nice so you don't feel out of place, but it's not a big deal - anybody gets in
Jimmyayo (2013-10-14 18:20): Also, Key Bar in EV has all-night happy hour (2-for-1) on sundays and mondays

Philly Phil (2013-10-14 18:23): I'm thinking yes to low key
Xander (2013-10-14 18:23): Plus it's friggin' Monday
Philly Phil (2013-10-14 18:23): the key bar thing might be good
Xander (2013-10-14 18:27): I gotta go home and freshen up
Xander (2013-10-14 18:27): I still have no idea what I'm doing
Xander (2013-10-14 18:31): Switching over from coding to social stuff always fucks with my head

Nate (2013-10-15 01:39) (1x <3): She wouldn't come back to my place, but we took a nice long walk and were constantly all over each other.  If we had done any more in public we'd have been arrested.
Xander (2013-10-15 02:24) (1x <3): I'm about to pull a Phil. I just might be out of the game, guys...
Xander (2013-10-15 02:24) (1x <3): I've found the One!

Nate (2013-10-15 11:07) (2x <3): Well he's beta, so it's par for that.
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:07): most chody shit I've ever heard
Xander (2013-10-15 11:08): Yeah...
Xander (2013-10-15 11:08) (2x <3): His Man Card expired a long time ago
Xander (2013-10-15 11:09): It's funny, somehow shit tests have come up as a topic of conversation in the last two dates I've been on
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:11): oh yeah? tell me more
Xander (2013-10-15 11:12): I'll explain to them what a shit test is, and they immediately recognize that they do it all the time
Xander (2013-10-15 11:12): Not that it matter, since it's so instinctual
Xander (2013-10-15 11:12): It's not like they can stop
Xander (2013-10-15 11:13): But I'll point out shit tests they have given me that I have galloped over with ease
Nate (2013-10-15 11:13): I barely notice shit tests any more it's become so easy to turn them around, except when women are all shit tests.
Xander (2013-10-15 11:13): Exactly, I can only even notice them in hindsight
Nate (2013-10-15 11:13) (1x <3): Except when every word is a shit test, then it starts to irritate me
Nate (2013-10-15 11:15): Time to go to a lunch meeting.  bleh.
Nate (2013-10-15 11:15): Employee engagement my ass
Xander (2013-10-15 11:16): lol
Xander (2013-10-15 11:17) (1x <3): Anyway, talking about alpha/beta and shit tests and the like seems to create giny tingles if you're fairly alpha yourself
Mark (2013-10-15 11:19): it also communicates to her: "i'm onto your shit"
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:20): haha I've gotta try that
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:20): I never notice shit tests even afterwards
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:20): most dates I try to stay so unattached and treat it as a science experiment where I'm just observing
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 11:20): helps me see things objectively
Xander (2013-10-15 11:22): That Agent Smith quote is so fitting for GayLife
Mark A (2013-10-15 11:44): @xandar the best conversation I have ever had involved, shit tests, bitch shields, judging others and other random things girls do.
Mark A (2013-10-15 11:45): One of my friends in Berlin, caught two girls rating guys - called them out on it.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 14:03): Out walking for an hour...didn't see anything i like
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 14:03) (2x <3): Until it was time to walk back to the office for a meeting, and of course I see 3 cute girls on my way back
Xander (2013-10-15 14:24): Hey guys, I want to be a mod on GothamLife because the current mods are... well, yeah.
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:24): Jimmy
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:25): Is one of them
Xander (2013-10-15 14:25): I didn't mean all of them
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:25): Haha
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:26): I was thinking about it. But only if they let me kill half of the group
Xander (2013-10-15 14:26): So if you feel like it, PM The liquid with a nomination
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:26): From 100 to 40
Xander (2013-10-15 14:26): I'm thinking of instilling an aggressive eugenics program
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:26) (1x <3): I dont have time for it
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:29): Xander u going out today or u r out
Mark A (2013-10-15 14:29): Of the game
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-15 14:30): Mark A changed name to Marky Mark
Xander (2013-10-15 14:31): I think I need to do my laundry...
Xander (2013-10-15 14:31): I'm leaving Thursday morning for a trip to Indiana and I'll be gone until Monday
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 14:33): Ok I took a break yesterday. So i understand.
Xander (2013-10-15 14:35): I might just end up going out tonight anyway
Xander (2013-10-15 14:38): What were you thinking of doing. 13th Step?
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 15:59) (1x <3): Maybe les.. I kinda sick of 13th Step too many guys
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 15:59): *im

Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:39): anyway
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:39): should I cancel and go hang out with portia
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:39): instead
Mark (2013-10-15 16:40): double book and if they both don't flake, cancel one of them an hour prior
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:41): I mean I don't think either would flake on me
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:41): so I'd rather just cancel
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 16:41): now
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 16:42): Haha phil is rolling
Mark (2013-10-15 16:43): then go with portia, sounds like you are more into her

Xander (2013-10-15 16:44): Probably
Xander (2013-10-15 16:44) (2x <3): I almost flaked last night... I have a terrible flaking tendency
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 16:45): Thank god u didn't bc u found the one

Xander (2013-10-15 17:47): @Marky Mark That's the worst costume idea ever
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 17:47) (2x <3): Marky Mark - did you get the skin eating disease from Xander?
Xander (2013-10-15 17:48): Hey, it's finally starting to get a little better! I guess that the urushiol allergen is dissipating after permeating my entire body
Xander (2013-10-15 17:56) (1x <3): I know it's tacky, but I kinda want to dress up as some Mario Bros characters. I'm thinking with a hipster spin
Xander (2013-10-15 17:57): http://laughingsquid.com/super-mario-bros-characters-reimagined-as-hipsters/
Xander (2013-10-15 18:32): LOL @contro posting the Vitaly gold digger prank on facebook
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 19:04): So everyone is hitting up 13th
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 19:04): Now I definitely don't want to be there for long
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 19:22): Oh I was thinking of bouncing Portia there too. 1 dollars beers are awesome
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 19:27): Hahaha
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 19:28): Be prepared for her to be hit on like crazy.
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 19:28): On Thursday, this guy had his hot date with him at 13. Everytime he moved away she got approached.
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 19:54): That's fine I like to watch
Philly Phil (2013-10-15 19:54): And see them get blown out
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:02): Haha
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:02) (2x <3): Lots of puas in 13 tonight watch out. U may not find her when u come back. Hahaha
Xander (2013-10-15 20:41): You there Mark?
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:42): No just finished all my phone calls. My god my family talks nonstop
Xander (2013-10-15 20:42): I'm right next to the grove street stop. Heading out in a few
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:42): Shower then going.
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:43): Should take me max 15mins to get out from now.
Marky Mark (2013-10-15 20:43): Text me about to turn data off
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 20:46) (2x <3): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzm6TEManmQ
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 20:46): I love this video
Jimmyayo (2013-10-15 20:46) (2x <3): Gonna pick up heavy objects off the floor now
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 01:20): One number tonight but it's a good one
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 01:20): I think
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 02:32) (1x <3): #close then date closed (if that exists)
Nate (2013-10-16 08:33) (1x <3): It exists
Nate (2013-10-16 08:42): Got flaked on last night. Gonna need to get more numbers today. Don't feel like seeing an old one.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 09:09): Morning gents
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 09:09): What is a date close
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 09:14) (1x <3): Setting up a date at a bar?
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 09:14): I'm assuming
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 09:24): Ahhh
Nate (2013-10-16 09:24): I was assuming closing a girl on a first date
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 09:27): So Phil, did you take your date to 13th step last night???
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 09:51): She flaked on him
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 09:51): :( was looking to steal her
Nate (2013-10-16 09:53): Last night was a flakey night...
Mark (2013-10-16 09:55) (3x <3): thats why you double book
Nate (2013-10-16 09:58): yeah, makes sense.  I didn't think the one yesterday would flake.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:01): If there's anything that's constant in pickup, its that girls will flake
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:01): Sad truth, for attractive girls. I blame society, and letting hot girls get away with bullshit behavior
Nate (2013-10-16 10:02): Fortunately I was really tired last night, so I didn't so much care.
Nate (2013-10-16 10:02): Watched Pacific Rim.  Bad movie, still fun.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:03) (3x <3): I've learned to never care about the first cpl dates w/ a girl, until she means more to me than a fuckhole
Mark (2013-10-16 10:05): I saw Gravity at the IMAX over the weekend... amazing film
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:06): I've heard mixed things ^
Nate (2013-10-16 10:07): I feel motion sick just thinking about it.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:07): Wow...it got a 98% on rotten tomatoes
Mark (2013-10-16 10:08): its a bit more subtle than most action movies... some people didnt like it because of this
Mark (2013-10-16 10:09): if you liked children of men, youll like gravity... same director
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): hm
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): oh I did like that
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): I saw don jon
Mark (2013-10-16 10:09): how was that
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): with a chick.. good movie to see with a chick cause there's a ton of sex
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): it was pretty good
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:09): and hilarious
Mark (2013-10-16 10:10): nice
Mark (2013-10-16 10:11): heard that was a bunch of porn in it ha
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:12): yep
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:13): and sex too
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:22): http://www.businessinsider.com/the-gselevator-guide-to-being-a-man-2013-9
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:22): Have you guys seen this
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:23): I thought a lot of it was pretty good
Nate (2013-10-16 10:24): Decent list yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:24): Some of it is overly pretentious (or, more likely, I'm just not in that upper echelon of society that casually says "Ask for Sammy at the Mandarin Oriental Barbershop in Hong Kong")
Mark (2013-10-16 10:28): i interned there a few years ago and it was like this giant cult
Mark (2013-10-16 10:28): everyone dressed the same... same haircut
Mark (2013-10-16 10:28): they pay you well though, although you have to put in at least 12hrs/day
Nate (2013-10-16 10:28): Actually a glass or 2 of wine will ruin my day...
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:30) (1x <3): I think I do most of these things already
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:30): but I also disagree with a bunch of them
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:30): like split the check
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:30): and tip a lot
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:31): or don't split the check I mean
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:31): fuck that shit
Nate (2013-10-16 10:31) (2x <3): and one girlfriend at a time is enough...
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:32): Piercings are liabilities in fights.
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:32): that's so true
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:32): I"ll totally rip a guys piercings out right after I kick him in the nuts and punch him in the gut
Nate (2013-10-16 10:34) (2x <3): I'll do what Alan Shore did in Boston Legal.  Someone challenges me to a fight, pay the 2 guys behind me 100 bucks to fight for me...
Mark (2013-10-16 10:35): Phil, keep in mind that these guys have more money than common sense
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:36): god to know
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:36): good*
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:39): God I miss that show Nate
Nate (2013-10-16 10:39): Yeah it was awesome
Nate (2013-10-16 10:40): Watch "The Blacklist" though.  James Spader basically owns that show.  He is just soooo good.
Xander (2013-10-16 10:41): @Jimmyayo I have seen that list before
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 10:43): It's slightly american psycho-esque, and I like it
Nate (2013-10-16 10:45): http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/american-psycho.jpg
Xander (2013-10-16 10:46): Did you know Ted Bundy had a border collie named Lassie!?
Xander (2013-10-16 10:46): Who's Ted Bundy?
Nate (2013-10-16 10:47): http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e3CeszsPSok/T78L4mjcBcI/AAAAAAAABfw/_HCYDPDhz2A/s1600/AlBundyOnCouch.jpg
Xander (2013-10-16 10:47): I might be done with night game, bros.
Xander (2013-10-16 10:48): I think that I'm going to do a 30-day challenge type thing this month of running day game
Nate (2013-10-16 10:50): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYi61ZhSZ74
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:51): enter mr xan man
Mark (2013-10-16 10:52) (1x <3): Xander, you should join Phil and I... were going to put in more time daygaming
Mark (2013-10-16 10:52): find a job in midtown
Xander (2013-10-16 10:52): lol
Mark (2013-10-16 10:52): youre a bright guy, shouldnt be difficult
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:53): plus he has my recruiter
Mark (2013-10-16 10:54) (2x <3): game translates very well to interviews, ive found
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:56): so this girl I was hanging out with last night
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:56): her friend gave her number out to like 6 different guys
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:56): and she was talking about how they were all texting her and she has no idea who's who
Xander (2013-10-16 10:57): @Philly Phil Yeah, I remember her flirting hardcore with a bunch of different dudes
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:57): she was flirting with me
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:57): right in front of her friend
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 10:57): Which one was that
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:58): she had brown hair that was up
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:58): really cute with a nose ring
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:58): alison
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 10:59): oh I forgot me and mark originally approached that group
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:00): Ur energy was higher than mine so I just laid back for a bit until I caught on
Nate (2013-10-16 11:00): She'll probably delete most/all of those numbers the next day
Xander (2013-10-16 11:00) (2x <3): I'm over 13th Step
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:00): I'm not ^
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:00): you can still do well there
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:00): last night kind of sucked
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:01): I just had a stroke of good fortune
Xander (2013-10-16 11:01): I didn't think the blonde you were talking to was anything special
Nate (2013-10-16 11:01): I was gonna do day game this evening, but I think I just converted an old number to a date...  Waiting for final confirmation.
Xander (2013-10-16 11:01): To be frank
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:01): I liked her
Xander (2013-10-16 11:01): Her friend was hotter
Xander (2013-10-16 11:01): But also... whatever-er
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:01): Taylor or something
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:01): oh yeah there was a third friend
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:02): idk I liked the blond she was witty and cute
Nate (2013-10-16 11:02): I don't remember what this girl looks like.  All I remember was I think she was a brunette.
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:02): The blond that I was talking to was hot. But they were bitches fyi
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:03): eh
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:04): there were hotter girls there
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:04): but I liked mine
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:04): she was pretty intelligent
Xander (2013-10-16 11:04): The girl I met there who I really like, that was a fluke
Xander (2013-10-16 11:05): She's the kind of girl one would usually only meet during day game
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:06): Is the girl off limits if u tell other guys u date closed?
Xander (2013-10-16 11:06): I'm growing weary of the drunken milieu 
Nate (2013-10-16 11:07): I have a drunken milieu, but it's with girls I've met on day game
Xander (2013-10-16 11:09): I enjoy the one-on-one date things and I enjoy the crowds of day game
Xander (2013-10-16 11:09): But putting the drinking and the crowds together...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 11:09): Depends if u have a bro-code w/ him mark
Xander (2013-10-16 11:09): I'm not 22 any more
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 11:09): At a place like 13, I'd imagine its every man for himself
Nate (2013-10-16 11:10): @Xander so do day game.  I have the same problem.  I'm 36 and can't handle going out every night.  I've got maybe 1 or 2 nights a week max in me before I start suffering in other parts of my life.
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:10): Jimmy makes sense
Xander (2013-10-16 11:10) (1x <3): @Nate It's not even that I can't physically take it so much as psychologically
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:11): well don't go out as much
Xander (2013-10-16 11:11): I start hating people
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:11): last night was the first night I went out in like a week and a half
Xander (2013-10-16 11:11) (2x <3): And instead of building value in myself through lifting, I'm actively destroying myself through excessive drinking
Nate (2013-10-16 11:12): @Xander I'm doing that too, but on one on one dates.  I may have to stop drinking for a while to get my physical back.
Nate (2013-10-16 11:13): Well this weekend I won't really be drinking.  Friday I'm probably taking a girl out for sushi, and Saturday my mother's gonna be visiting me so no chicks.
Nate (2013-10-16 11:14): @Xander if either today or tomorrow I don't work out to have a date I'll day game with ya after work.
Nate (2013-10-16 11:15) (1x <3): @Xander by the way on Monday you had perfect intelligence when meeting my date..
Xander (2013-10-16 11:15): I'm leaving tomorrow morning for Indiana
Xander (2013-10-16 11:16): I'll be gone until Monday
Nate (2013-10-16 11:16): okee
Xander (2013-10-16 11:16): @Nate "perfect intelligence"?
Nate (2013-10-16 11:16): You played along with whatever I made up, and stayed just long enough to not be a burden to my making out with her more.
Xander (2013-10-16 11:17) (2x <3): @Nate Ah, yes. I'm a master at DHVing my wings
Nate (2013-10-16 11:18): She's who I'm taking to sushi Friday.
Xander (2013-10-16 11:18): I swear I've made Phil look like Christ cometh several times
Nate (2013-10-16 11:18): lol
Nate (2013-10-16 11:19): I asked her out last night and she didn't answer directly, so I played it cool, but I doubt she's gonna say no.  She was sooo into me.
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 11:19) (1x <3): lol okay @xander
Nate (2013-10-16 11:21): I can't believe how that bill cosby clip has stuck with me for more than 20 years...
Xander (2013-10-16 11:23): http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/09/drake-lyrics-text/
Xander (2013-10-16 11:23): Did someone already post this in the other group? I can't remember
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:53): Who's up for going on a pub crawl tonight
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:53): 
SoHo Pub Crawl



• 3 SoHo bars & lounges (including a bar from a world famous television series) followed by NYC’s hottest speakeasy hidden deep in the Little Italy underground, featuring all bespoke cocktails!
• Free SHOTS & incredible “pub crawl only” drink deals!
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 11:53): $20
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:09) (3x <3): Ugh Marky Mark, RIGHT after we literally discussed not partying/drinking too much 
Xander (2013-10-16 12:20): I'm going to be busy packing/getting ready for my little trip tonight anyway
Nate (2013-10-16 12:20): *packing*
Xander (2013-10-16 12:20) (1x <3): Properly disposing of those refrigerated hookers I killed last week
Nate (2013-10-16 12:21): Speaking of packing have you signed a lease yet for a new place?
Xander (2013-10-16 12:21): Nope
Nate (2013-10-16 12:21): I prefer my hookers frozen, they last longer
Xander (2013-10-16 12:21): I think that R Schmitty is going to take the spot at Nilay's that her offered me for dirt cheap
Xander (2013-10-16 12:21): *he
Xander (2013-10-16 12:22): I probably should have just accepted the offer, since it would have been temporary anyway
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:23): So I feel like I've been a little off my game lately, neglecting my reading, exercising, rest.  Had a beast of a workout last night: squats, bench, power cleans, and finished w/ a <6min mile sprint.

Today I feel incredible. 
Nate (2013-10-16 12:23) (1x <3): I need to really focus on my health more.  Neglecting that has started catching up to me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:24) (1x <3): Mind & body
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:24) (2x <3): Trumps booty
Nate (2013-10-16 12:24): ya
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:25): I liked this post for that extra push to get my lazy ass to the gym
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:25) (1x <3): http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1m6c6c/motivation/cc67k59
Xander (2013-10-16 12:27): Nice
Xander (2013-10-16 12:27): I keep thinking of this tweet I saved from @PlayDangerously:
Xander (2013-10-16 12:27) (2x <3): 10 hrs week in gym + 10 hours of cold approaching > 40 hours of cold approaching. When you build value, cold approaches become warm.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:31): Working out goes a long way towards building healthy self-validation, improved confidence, and a non-needy mindset
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:32) (2x <3): When I devote too much time into pickup (and neglect other things), I start focusing my self-worth on results I get from women
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 12:32): Which is counter productive
Xander (2013-10-16 12:33): @Jimmyayo Yep
Mark (2013-10-16 12:52) (3x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4fb706a018b10131c32f7214ac9aefa1
Mark (2013-10-16 12:52): seeing this cute French girl on Sunday
Xander (2013-10-16 12:55): Would Jizz
Nate (2013-10-16 12:55): Dolled up that girl would be a 9
Mark (2013-10-16 12:57): c'est si bon
Nate (2013-10-16 13:02) (1x <3): French is such a turn on.
Nate (2013-10-16 13:02): Where'd you meet her?
Mark (2013-10-16 13:04) (1x <3): union sq
Nate (2013-10-16 13:04): Gold mine
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 13:06): Cute
Nate (2013-10-16 13:07) (1x <3): It does look like a mugshot tho
Mark (2013-10-16 13:07): ill tell her to bring her handcuffs
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 13:08): It kinda does look like mugshot but I think it's a passport photo. Someone wants a greencard.
Nate (2013-10-16 13:09): Arrested for public indecency, shoplifting, urinating on a public figure, and resisting arrest.
Mark (2013-10-16 13:10): good first date conversation
Nate (2013-10-16 13:10) (2x <3): I love making up stories about girls while talking to them where they commit crimes, do evil things, and other fun
Mark (2013-10-16 13:11) (2x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ed5d479018b3013141b45e524809e69d
Nate (2013-10-16 13:11): I'm in love
Mark (2013-10-16 13:12): yeah they love the whole role play bit
Mark (2013-10-16 13:12): i like how she doesn't take herself too seriously
Xander (2013-10-16 13:56): Arrested for being too damn sexy.
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 14:13): Cute
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 14:36) (1x <3): god I'm so fucking bored
Mark (2013-10-16 14:44): Phil, I'm going to walk downtown after work, you're welcome to join
Mark (2013-10-16 14:45): you too Jimmy
Xander (2013-10-16 14:45): I'm going to miss you guys this weekend.
Xander (2013-10-16 14:45): I'm going to take a bunch of pictures of my midwest conquests
Nate (2013-10-16 15:07): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/1c6b1ee018c4013118be6ea8a95a94b4
Nate (2013-10-16 15:07): @Jesus, what would you say here
Xander (2013-10-16 15:09): lol, I would love to have you send something hilariously cheesy
Xander (2013-10-16 15:09): "Sometimes love blindsides us"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:10): In a good way, I hope ;)
Mark (2013-10-16 15:10): i'd say "With my charm and good looks"
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 15:18): "i have that affect on people." @nate
Xander (2013-10-16 15:19) (1x <3): @Marky Mark You mean "effect"
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 15:20): Yeah was about to correct myself
Nate (2013-10-16 15:21): I went with the first Mark's suggestion.
Xander (2013-10-16 15:21): Good
Xander (2013-10-16 15:21) (1x <3): That's what you should have done
Xander (2013-10-16 15:21): But you already knew that, didn't you?
Nate (2013-10-16 15:21): Yep
Nate (2013-10-16 15:21): Well, we'll see depending on what she says :)
Nate (2013-10-16 15:22): or doesn't
Xander (2013-10-16 15:22): There is nothing you could have said that would be better than Mark's suggestion
Xander (2013-10-16 15:22): Perhaps equal, but not better
Nate (2013-10-16 15:22): I agree
Xander (2013-10-16 15:23) (1x <3): There is a cap on the effectiveness of witty text replies
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 15:23): Its all about how cocky u want to sound.
Xander (2013-10-16 15:23) (2x <3): Occasionally, I myself break through that ceiling and momentarily touch godhood, but only when the stars have aligned perfectly.
Nate (2013-10-16 15:24): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/6f9ebad018c601313ef47e63506dad21
Nate (2013-10-16 15:24): This is her whatsapp pic :)
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 15:24) (2x <3): Xander u crazy
Mark (2013-10-16 15:28) (1x <3): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olEbwhWDYwM
Xander (2013-10-16 15:37): @Philly Phil http://youtu.be/4TdczoetXk4
Xander (2013-10-16 15:37): http://youtu.be/4TdczoetXk4
Nate (2013-10-16 15:37) (1x <3): Stepanie replied "LOL"
Xander (2013-10-16 15:37): Hahaha
Nate (2013-10-16 15:38) (1x <3): Should I stop texting her?
Nate (2013-10-16 15:39): Not sure if I should keep going, or quit while I'm ahead
Xander (2013-10-16 15:39): Yes, stop texting her for a while
Xander (2013-10-16 15:39): Leave her hanging
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:40): Not sure what I was going for here lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:40): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/cbe4810018c801310ed45ef1c42f11de
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:42): I got this match in like May
Xander (2013-10-16 15:42): I wouldn't have even answered her, would have launched straight into something else
Nate (2013-10-16 15:43): @Xander when you say a while you mean like tonight, tomorrow?
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:43): Ah well
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:43) (1x <3): Tomorrow I think
Xander (2013-10-16 15:43): Yep
Nate (2013-10-16 15:43): okee
Nate (2013-10-16 15:44): Since I'm asking, what should I text her tomorrow?  Just ask her out for a specific time, or more bullshit?
Xander (2013-10-16 15:44): @Philly Phil That movie trailer is our inspiration
Xander (2013-10-16 15:44) (1x <3): A little more bullshit, then ask her out a specific time
Nate (2013-10-16 15:45): This is the point tho where my mind isn't properly trained to come up with bullshit.
Nate (2013-10-16 15:45): at least in texting
Xander (2013-10-16 15:45): Haha
Nate (2013-10-16 15:45): I never know what to say
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:46): Doesn't have to be anything too elaborate tbh
Nate (2013-10-16 15:46): example?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:47): One that I've sent in the past was "oh gawd was just at the gym, this gay guy eye-fucked me the entire time"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:47) (1x <3): I mean, it could be anything
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 15:48): So I was thinking of texting that magic girl this tomorrow or something: "I think you just killed like 500 fairies. You're going to have to clap till your hands are raw"
Xander (2013-10-16 15:48) (1x <3): Yeah, like when I told this girl "God is good!"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:48): "I just woke up 20% more awesome.  How bout u"
Xander (2013-10-16 15:48): "Some crazy guy told me that this morning"
Nate (2013-10-16 15:49): I get it :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:49): (that's a GOL special)
Xander (2013-10-16 15:49): No wonder I hate it...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:49): I used it once as an unclogger, it worked fine 
Mark (2013-10-16 15:50): Nate, i think you should keep the convo going because she's investing... you want to ask for the date at an emotional peak... no reason to throw away the momentum you've got
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:50): Btw Mark, I'll join u for the walk after work
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:50): I might need a little push FYI
Mark (2013-10-16 15:50): 6?
Xander (2013-10-16 15:50): @Nate If you keep the convo going, don't keep it going for much longer
Nate (2013-10-16 15:51): If I did keep it going I have no idea what to say.  :)
Xander (2013-10-16 15:53): Then don't. Wait til tomorrow
Nate (2013-10-16 15:53): okay
Nate (2013-10-16 15:53) (2x <3): One of my goals for the next month or so is to get better at my text game.
Nate (2013-10-16 15:54): I'm gonna read some of those ebooks on text game that are floating around
Xander (2013-10-16 15:54): I'm done with GayLife for a while, especially after MidnightGrundleBoy and company were like, "Texting doesn't matter!"
Nate (2013-10-16 15:54): Fuck yes it matters.
Xander (2013-10-16 15:55): Oh right, I had a bunch of links to CH text game bullshit that I was supposed to post for you guys
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:56) (2x <3): "Whenever I see a bruised apple I give it a hug and whisper 'who did this to you?'"
Nate (2013-10-16 15:56): - Jack Handey
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 15:57): Actually I think that one was will farrell
Nate (2013-10-16 15:57): After I read some text game stuff, I'm gonna get some day game numbers that I'm just going to text for a least a couple weeks.  Just for practice.
Nate (2013-10-16 15:58): Sounds like deep thoughts
Nate (2013-10-16 16:01): If the girl tonight flakes (she said she might have to work late), want company @jimmy/mark?
Mark (2013-10-16 16:02): sure, don't know how long i'm gonna stay out though
Mark (2013-10-16 16:03): my eyes fail me when it gets dark
Nate (2013-10-16 16:03): Not sure yet anyway.  Gonna text her after 5 and see if she's gonna bitch out on me.
Mark (2013-10-16 16:03): maybe you can teach me some of this nighttime daygame stuff
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 16:03): Try opening them Mark
Mark (2013-10-16 16:03): i need lasik
Nate (2013-10-16 16:03): Except for your poor vision, night day game = day game
Nate (2013-10-16 16:03): Only difference is its even easier to get instadates
Mark (2013-10-16 16:03): i cant tell the 40 and 20 yr olds apart from a distance
Nate (2013-10-16 16:04): If you're attracted enough to approach them from far it won't kill you to have a conversation for a couple mins :)
Nate (2013-10-16 16:04): you might like the 40yr old :)
Mark (2013-10-16 16:05) (2x <3): true... i should just do it in the spirit of practice
Nate (2013-10-16 16:06) (2x <3): Also go see an eye doctor
Mark (2013-10-16 16:07): my eyes are like just bad enough to the point where i can see function without glasses
Mark (2013-10-16 16:07): still*
Xander (2013-10-16 16:07): I have reading glasses
Mark (2013-10-16 16:07): i used to wear glasses in class because i couldn't see the blackboard from the back of the room
Nate (2013-10-16 16:08) (2x <3): Mark, my vision is not unlike yours.  You get so used to it because you can function.  When I got contacts and my vision became normal, my quality of life went up quite a bit.  You don't realize what you're missing until you have it.
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 16:09): I remember in 3rd grade when that happened to me
Mark (2013-10-16 16:09): haha this is a yelp review for a LASIK center in midtown:
Mark (2013-10-16 16:09) (2x <3): "I loved getting Lasik! As a fan of hallucinogenics I loved all the different tests they give to check if your eyes are qualified."
Nate (2013-10-16 16:19) (1x <3): I hate doing pivot table queries
Xander (2013-10-16 16:20): Alright everyone, I somehow can't find where I saved your email addresses
Xander (2013-10-16 16:20): So ship em my way again
Nate (2013-10-16 16:20): natequest@gmail.com
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 16:20): philipleesha@gmail.com
Mark (2013-10-16 16:22): tradecraft9@gmail.com
Mark (2013-10-16 16:22): what kind of porn are you signing us up for
Xander (2013-10-16 16:23): Well, I'm not exactly sure of the name, but the guy puts an entire glass bottle up his ass, then it breaks and he starts spurting blood out of his rectum
Mark (2013-10-16 16:23) (2x <3): no thx, already seen it
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 16:24): Aalqas@gmail.com
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 16:25): Xander that was in a Fucking hospital right
Xander (2013-10-16 16:25): Anyone know Jimmy and David's?
Nate (2013-10-16 16:26): I know jimmy's, but he's here so he should give it to you
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 16:27): Jimboyoo@gmail.com
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 16:27): Davidt522@gmail.com
Xander (2013-10-16 16:28): Sweet
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 16:33) (1x <3): oh hey thanks for adding mine
Xander (2013-10-16 16:34) (1x <3): Alright, just sent out some links to you bros
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 16:36): grassy ass
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 16:37) (2x <3): AHHHH halal guys spicy sauce in my eye
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 16:37): fuck that hurts
Nate (2013-10-16 16:39): fyi never rub your eyes when cutting hot peppers
Mark (2013-10-16 16:40) (4x <3): good shit Xander
Xander (2013-10-16 16:42) (2x <3): We are truly in the age of texting
Xander (2013-10-16 16:54) (1x <3): Crap, if all of you guys become pro texters, I won't have anything to set myself apart
Xander (2013-10-16 16:59): It's time for me to start pioneering some other niche, like addiction recovery meetup game.
Mark (2013-10-16 17:00) (2x <3): as long as you stay away from my leukemia Tuesdays and ovarian cancer Thursdays
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 17:10): Mark.. What movie was that from again, forgot the name.
Mark (2013-10-16 17:11) (2x <3): Gone with the Wind
Nate (2013-10-16 17:37): I'd knock Sandeep's texting, but mine is probably not much better.  He is vastly missing the point tho.
Xander (2013-10-16 17:38): Yes, seriously.
Xander (2013-10-16 17:38): I feel like taking him on a weekend backpacking trip or something
Xander (2013-10-16 17:38): And then beating the shit out of him in the woods
Xander (2013-10-16 17:39): Until he stops being beta
Nate (2013-10-16 17:39) (1x <3): I think he is genuinely afraid of actually fucking a woman, but doesn't realize that's what is driving him.
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 17:40): is he a virgin
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 17:40): because that wouldn't surprise me at all
Xander (2013-10-16 17:40): Me neither
Nate (2013-10-16 17:41): He said had one sexual experience with someone who can accurately be described as needing to be committed.
Nate (2013-10-16 17:41) (1x <3): I'm not sure if it's true tho
Nate (2013-10-16 17:41) (1x <3): the second part is my words
Xander (2013-10-16 17:42) (2x <3): Someone should hire him an escort. Humanitarian of the year award
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 17:42) (1x <3): incoming midnight grumble boy insight
Nate (2013-10-16 17:44): He is right in one sense, if you don't understand the theory behind what is being said at all, it might as well be in latin.
Nate (2013-10-16 17:45): Kitty just emailed me "How's your conquer of the world going?"
Nate (2013-10-16 17:45): err texted
Nate (2013-10-16 17:45): After our date she asked my next plans and I said conquer the world
Nate (2013-10-16 17:46): I feel like responding just because I have so many fun responses to that question.
Nate (2013-10-16 17:46): "I conquered Greenland, but Zimbabwe is being stubborn"
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 17:54): xander thanks for the links, do you read a lot of theory?
Xander (2013-10-16 17:55): At this point, not really
Xander (2013-10-16 17:55): Since I basically read theory as a full-time job for an entire year
Xander (2013-10-16 17:55): When I wasn't working or going to school...
Nate (2013-10-16 17:56): aaaaand the girl flaked
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 17:56): lol cool
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 17:56): i meant xander's comment
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 17:56): not nates lol
Nate (2013-10-16 17:56): I know :)
Xander (2013-10-16 17:56): lol
Xander (2013-10-16 17:56): I could probably write a graduate-level dissertation on modern masculinity
Xander (2013-10-16 17:59): But fuck that
Xander (2013-10-16 18:00): I'm too busy trying to put my theory into practice
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 18:01): I need to read more
Philly Phil (2013-10-16 18:01): I'm at a sticking point right now
Xander (2013-10-16 18:02): Well, I have plenty of links for you
Xander (2013-10-16 18:03): Let me know what you think the sticking point is so I can tailor what I send you
Xander (2013-10-16 18:14): @Nate More time to do your text game homework
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 18:59): How many of you call ur dates to confirm and if you do how long before.
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 19:02): This goes back to calling instead of texting. Its always better to call but I'm lazy :)
Xander (2013-10-16 19:03) (1x <3): I don't call, just text unless something wrong is happening
Xander (2013-10-16 19:03) (1x <3): Like I'm gonna be significantly late or have to reschedule
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 19:11): Thx bud
Hot Tongs (2013-10-16 19:23): What to say? ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/dd06695018e7013152703ad0d8c660ab
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 19:26): Change the subject
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 19:27): To something else that u guys talked about
Marky Mark (2013-10-16 19:28): But Xander is the master
Jimmyayo (2013-10-16 20:58) (1x <3): "Well that's quite an assumption ;)"

Xander (2013-10-16 21:10): Fml.
Xander (2013-10-16 21:11): Fuck this apartment and fuck my property manager and his dog. I'm out of here
Xander (2013-10-16 21:20): I like Jimmy's suggestion but without a smiley face
Xander (2013-10-16 21:57) (3x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/739cd79018fd0131c698265421a3834a

Xander (2013-10-16 22:32): She still looks better in person. Doesn't seem to photograph well for some reason
Nate (2013-10-16 22:32): Yeah I noticed that
Nate (2013-10-16 22:33) (1x <3): I have the same problem.  Most of my pics I look drunk, or high, or retarded
Xander (2013-10-16 22:37): Lol
Xander (2013-10-16 22:37): I don't want to go on this stupid fucking trip tomorrow
Nate (2013-10-16 22:39): Ugh I hate whatsapp, I asked her out Friday night and I know she read it and hasn't said anything yet.  First time I'm obsessing in a while.
Nate (2013-10-16 22:39): Yeah thats a long trip.  You should have paid someone to ship that crap to you.
Xander (2013-10-16 22:40): Seriously. I'm probably just losing my mind
Nate (2013-10-16 22:41) (2x <3): Dammit woman, answer my message!
Xander (2013-10-16 22:43) (1x <3): Man, I troll so hard on Tinder. I'm not even trying to pick up girls on there any more
Nate (2013-10-16 22:43): lol
Xander (2013-10-16 22:51): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f70bc3201904013196d40a148875feb8
Xander (2013-10-16 22:51): Did my goddamn pics go through?
Xander (2013-10-16 22:51): After she didn't give me her number, my troll level went up exponentially ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f8a2bbb0190401314e76621011497134
Xander (2013-10-16 22:53): I missed a few messages in there, but whatevs ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4a3677801905013152703ad0d8c660ab

Marky Mark (2013-10-16 23:19): Haha
Xander (2013-10-16 23:35): Think I'm blowing up the main chat...
Xander (2013-10-17 00:06) (2x <3): Just in case anyone misses this: ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/5a0e0d10190f01315e1f1a95bcd6217d
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 00:07): Wow ^
Xander (2013-10-17 00:07): Also, winnnnnn's text
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 00:07): Hahha I was going to ask if it was real
Xander (2013-10-17 00:18) (1x <3): Jesus H. Christ ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/126d8f70191101314e76621011497134
Mark (2013-10-17 00:37): haha this shit is gold

Xander (2013-10-17 00:41): I want to preserve this one too
Mark (2013-10-17 00:44): Holy shit
Mark (2013-10-17 00:45) (1x <3): This is why the community gets a bad rep
Xander (2013-10-17 00:45): I feel like I'm reading shit off of Texts From Last Night
Mark (2013-10-17 00:46) (1x <3): You can literally smell the date rape on your computer screen
Xander (2013-10-17 00:47) (1x <3): I still feel like date rape requires more balls than they have
Mark (2013-10-17 00:47): The first sentence of Sandeep's tinder tagline is just wtf...
Xander (2013-10-17 00:49): I mean, if winnnnnnn keeps handling his sets like that, it makes it easier for the rest of us, right...?
Mark (2013-10-17 00:50): Don't overestimate the competition
Xander (2013-10-17 00:51): I can't wait to have my soul lit ablaze with relentless desire
Mark (2013-10-17 00:52) (1x <3): I love how you try to help them and it's like talking to a brick wall
Xander (2013-10-17 00:52): Yeah
Xander (2013-10-17 00:53): It's alright, they can continue to pay money to their false prophets, like Ganster of Love
Xander (2013-10-17 00:53): *Gangster
Mark (2013-10-17 00:54) (1x <3): The blind leading the blind
Mark (2013-10-17 00:55) (1x <3): I kinda want to go to this Friday meetup out of morbid curiousity
Xander (2013-10-17 00:55): Hahaha
Xander (2013-10-17 00:55): I'm sad that I won't be able to attend
Xander (2013-10-17 00:58): Can't believe that it's already been a month since the last one
Nate (2013-10-17 07:57) (1x <3): Oh god Sandeep.  If you aren't a virgin, you just got it back...
Nate (2013-10-17 07:59) (1x <3): He has "fuck hard" in his tagline, with what is essentially pedobear in the background...
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:16): i asked a girl if what happened between us (went for drinks, hooked up) she did often, and she asked why I asked, what should i sa? I want to say 'because i wanted to see if it meant anything to you', but is that too forward? or i could say 'cus i wanted to see if youre a slut', but that won't go over well..
Xander (2013-10-17 09:16): Damn...
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:17): ?
Xander (2013-10-17 09:17): You basically used a female shit test: "Are you a player?"
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:18): oh i didnt even realize
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:19): at first she said "every night, when possible" and we talked about something else, then she came back and asked why i asked..
Nate (2013-10-17 09:23) (1x <3): "because i wanted to see if it meant anything to you" - I'm fitting you for a vagina...
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:23): what?
Nate (2013-10-17 09:24) (1x <3): That sounds like something a girl would say
Xander (2013-10-17 09:24): She also gave you an alpha response to your shit test...
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:24): "i wanted to see what kind of person you are"?
Nate (2013-10-17 09:24): Yeah, she basically said something that one of us would say
Nate (2013-10-17 09:25): @hot you basically said you're looking to judge her for being a slut...
Nate (2013-10-17 09:25): That's what that last one meant
Nate (2013-10-17 09:25): If you want her to never see you again, that's the right thing to say
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:25): lolol
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:25): what should i say then??
Nate (2013-10-17 09:26): "You were pretty damn good, I'm curious how much practice your getting"
Nate (2013-10-17 09:26): maybe
Nate (2013-10-17 09:26): You don't want to frame it as judging, you want to frame it as accepting
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:27): then i cant say i want to see if it meant anything to her? she moved back to europe and we are just like emailing now..
Nate (2013-10-17 09:27): You can't ask a girl direct questions like that.  They don't work that way.
Nate (2013-10-17 09:28): Also never ask if it meant something in the context of whether she's banging other guys.  Hence I'm fitting you for a vagina..
Nate (2013-10-17 09:28): If you want to know what your time together meant, it's in reference to your time together, not other people
Xander (2013-10-17 09:28) (1x <3): I love you Nate.
Nate (2013-10-17 09:29) (1x <3): Going to shower, be back in a bit.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:29): k
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:30): how about "just curious"
Xander (2013-10-17 09:30): Sounds too much like beta packpeddling
Xander (2013-10-17 09:30): Betas apologize for things they say, alphas own their shit
Xander (2013-10-17 09:31): "Because for a moment there, I thought I might have met my match"
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:31): "cus i thought you were going to dissapear once you went back to europe but we're still talking"
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:32): oooor "people these days, you never know"
Xander (2013-10-17 09:32): Nooooope
Xander (2013-10-17 09:32): Signaling that you're worried about her disappearing demonstrates a mindset of scarcity
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:33): this is a tough one to answer
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:34): she broke up with her bf of 7 years like 3 weeks ago
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:34): so i already knew she doesnt do that often
Xander (2013-10-17 09:35): It just seems like all of your potential answers are coming from a place of over-investment
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:36) (1x <3): i do like this one.. im considering flying there to see her
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:36): but i mean.. how would you continue something if they live so far?
Xander (2013-10-17 09:37) (1x <3): By being fun and romantic
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 09:37) (1x <3): So what r good date spots on or near 6ave
Xander (2013-10-17 09:37): Not by demonstrating your own insecurities about the relationship
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:38): how about "cus i really enjoyed our time"
Xander (2013-10-17 09:38): You can also ignore her question if you're having a hard time coming up with something decent
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:39): it will be a very obvious ignore though, its the last thing she said and she said "one question: ..."
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:39): ok ill ignore it
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 09:40): or should i say, "why do you think i asked?
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 09:44): Haha 'I was thinking about getting you a green card" that would be funny
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 09:44): But don't send it
Nate (2013-10-17 09:49) (1x <3): @Xander I have 2 solid leads and 2 probably flakey leads to contact today.  I REALLY suck at knowing how to open.
Nate (2013-10-17 09:49): via text
Xander (2013-10-17 09:55): Haha
Xander (2013-10-17 09:58): Have some fun with it
Xander (2013-10-17 09:58): Didn't I send you a million text game articles?
Nate (2013-10-17 09:58): Yeah, just haven't had time to read them yet :)
Xander (2013-10-17 10:00): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/confident-a-hole-game/
Xander (2013-10-17 10:00): Go the winnnnnn route, except more refined
Nate (2013-10-17 10:00) (1x <3): okay, reading as soon as i get to work. Thanks :)
Nate (2013-10-17 10:01) (2x <3): Yeah looking at the texts in the other chat is like drilling holes in my head
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:37): good morning
Nate (2013-10-17 10:38): good evening
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:38) (1x <3): I love saying that as a good bye ^
Xander (2013-10-17 10:51): I love walking away without saying a word as my goodbye
Nate (2013-10-17 10:51): hmm only 9 joins in my query, must be something wrong with it...
Nate (2013-10-17 10:53): I love watching the girl turn around as she's leaving to look at me
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:53) (2x <3): that girl jen told me that's called an irish exit @Xander
Xander (2013-10-17 10:54): Seriously, it's the best way to leave
Nate (2013-10-17 10:55) (1x <3): You know every time I think I'm starting to get good, I read something and realize just how much I have left to learn, and I feel like a beginner again.  I love it...
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:55): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:55): yay the government is working again
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:55): well sort of yay
Xander (2013-10-17 10:55) (2x <3): Aww shit, I hope they don't figure out I owe them a bunch of taxes
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:56): death and taxes Xander
Xander (2013-10-17 10:56): I'm working on solving both of them
Nate (2013-10-17 10:56): Don't worry, they'd never shut down the ird
Nate (2013-10-17 10:56): irs.
Xander (2013-10-17 10:57) (1x <3): Death, taxes and flaking
Nate (2013-10-17 10:57): Don't tell me your skin is falling off now.
Nate (2013-10-17 10:57): Zombie Xander
Xander (2013-10-17 10:58): My poison ivy has been healing. It's neck and neck with my outrageous hickeys, no pun intended
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 10:58): hah
Nate (2013-10-17 10:59): Badge of Honor
Nate (2013-10-17 10:59) (1x <3): I realized I don't suck nearly hard enough, I'm not branding my girls
Xander (2013-10-17 11:00): How could someone ever teach a guy like Sandeep that it isn't about tricks and techniques but the underlying attitude, the core essence of real masculinity, that gives rise to an attractive male?
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:01): I don't think its possible
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:01) (1x <3): he needs the mystery method
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:01): magic tricks, lines and crazy photos
Mark (2013-10-17 11:01) (3x <3): the first step is to not take profile pics in a children's toy store
Nate (2013-10-17 11:02): His problem is secretly he is afraid to really know, which is why he keeps saying he wants to skip all the necessary steps.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:02): He'd be better off making animalistic grunts instead of whatever else he's saying
Nate (2013-10-17 11:02) (1x <3): @Mark also helps if pedobear isn't in the background.
Nate (2013-10-17 11:03): I felt like I needed a shower just looking at that pic
Xander (2013-10-17 11:03): @Nate My second picture is essentially on Tinder is essentially in a toy adore
Xander (2013-10-17 11:04): *-is essentially
Nate (2013-10-17 11:04) (1x <3): I'm guessing though it has a rather different subtext than 'I want to kidnap your children'
Nate (2013-10-17 11:07): I can sorta relate, I used to be pretty freakin pathetic myself too.  It takes a lot of effort, time, and scotch to dig yourself out of a hole that big.
Nate (2013-10-17 11:07) (2x <3): He has to be willing to completely change his lifestyle.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:08): yeah he does
Nate (2013-10-17 11:08) (2x <3): His main problem is he thinks he knows things, and he doesn't.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:09): Seriously. At least I'm realistic about my sticking points
Nate (2013-10-17 11:10): I've always said I still feel like I know nothing comparatively...
Xander (2013-10-17 11:10) (1x <3): Oh man, I'm going to run game on my college's campus with all of the 18-20 year olds I've never met before!
Nate (2013-10-17 11:10): The worst thing you can have is ignorance
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:10): I don't really think about that stuff @nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:11): I mean the comparatively part
Nate (2013-10-17 11:11): @phil I think I came from a much lower state, and I still remember it pretty well.  Part of me is still waiting for it all to fall apart.
Nate (2013-10-17 11:11): ahh, okay
Nate (2013-10-17 11:11): okay yeah you can remove that word :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:12): yeah I mean
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:12) (1x <3): I feel like I know nothing
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:12): but I try my hardest not to compare myself to anyone but my past
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:12) (1x <3): even though thats sort of impossible at times
Nate (2013-10-17 11:12) (1x <3): The most important change in my mind is simply that I no longer subconsciously believe I'm cursed.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:13): haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:13): well you're not
Nate (2013-10-17 11:13): Nope, and I've had quite a bit of success recently.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:14): I'm trying to figure out my sticking points. I think its text game and mid game pre sex
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:14): that's where I start to care too much
Nate (2013-10-17 11:14) (1x <3): Text game, my mid game still needs work although it's starting to get a lot better, and if I actually like a girl a lot I still turn needy.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:14) (1x <3): and my stupid insecurities come out after I sleep with a girl I'm golden
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:15): yeah I think I would fine with post sex game even if I like her a lot
Nate (2013-10-17 11:15): That girl Lidiane I started acting needy in text yesterday...
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:15): because by that point she would be practically in love with me
Nate (2013-10-17 11:15): Almost fucked up bigtime
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:16): ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:16): how were you acting needy?
Xander (2013-10-17 11:16): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/12726d40196d0131c698265421a3834a
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:17): lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:18): you changed your main
Xander (2013-10-17 11:18): No, that's my second pic
Xander (2013-10-17 11:18): I was mainly showing how I'm in a toy store of sorts
Nate (2013-10-17 11:19): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/614ba0e0196d013152703ad0d8c660ab
Nate (2013-10-17 11:19): note the times
Xander (2013-10-17 11:19) (2x <3): Sandeep: "Omg. I am having too much fun with my AFC friend."
Xander (2013-10-17 11:19): It's creepy when you refer to yourself in the third person
Nate (2013-10-17 11:20): fyi sushi was actually her suggestion.  I was gonna make dinner.  So many mistakes...
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 11:20): haha
Nate (2013-10-17 11:22): During the end of date she also suggested we hang out next week and I suggested Friday...
Xander (2013-10-17 11:24) (1x <3): Damn dude...
Nate (2013-10-17 11:24): I did fantastically up to then though.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:25): You have to know when it's right to sprinkle in the beta
Nate (2013-10-17 11:25): Even after it was mostly my texting that is killing me
Nate (2013-10-17 11:25): Up until I turned on the needy, it was quite the opposite.
Nate (2013-10-17 11:26) (1x <3): Yeah well at least is looks like she's going to come out, so I didn't completely fuck up.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:26): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/74cdd780196e013152703ad0d8c660ab
Xander (2013-10-17 11:27): You could say that my text was beta, but it only served to help my cause, based on the context of how well our night went
Xander (2013-10-17 11:27): I also haven't texted her anything since then
Nate (2013-10-17 11:29): I mean it's not all bad here, she REALLY liked me on the date
Nate (2013-10-17 11:30): She was talking about things we could do together than couldn't possibly happen for at least a year from now...
Xander (2013-10-17 11:31): Haha
Xander (2013-10-17 11:32) (1x <3): @Nate This girl Dana is a pro, since she actually forced me to text like 10% more than her overall
Xander (2013-10-17 11:33) (1x <3): On the date, I had told her that I had all but written her off when I didn't really hear from her, and the hickeys on my neck showed that I wasn't bluffing
Nate (2013-10-17 11:34): Well in my case I'm gonna do the smart thing and not text her till Friday afternoon.
Nate (2013-10-17 11:37): Either way, while she was a lot fun, she's eaily replaceable, so my momentary stupidity isn't exactly that big a deal :)
Xander (2013-10-17 11:37): Good man
Xander (2013-10-17 11:37) (1x <3): @Philly Phil Fuck Phil, I was about to leave GayLife! You stole my thunder!
Nate (2013-10-17 11:38): haha
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 11:44) (1x <3): I want to go to Lavo
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 11:44) (1x <3): Anybody been
Xander (2013-10-17 11:44) (1x <3): I want to go to homo
Mark (2013-10-17 11:44) (2x <3): i hear there's a gathering of them tomorrow evening
Nate (2013-10-17 11:44) (1x <3): That's the other chat Xander
Nate (2013-10-17 11:45): I'm gonna read the rational male too, I need a booster shot of slap in the face.
Mark (2013-10-17 11:46): we are waiting for your review of that book Xander
Nate (2013-10-17 11:46): yeah
Xander (2013-10-17 11:46): I'm about halfway through it
Xander (2013-10-17 11:46): It's good shit. I know 95% of it already from binging on manosphere material for a year straight last year, but it's an excellent compilation, especially for hardcase noobs
Xander (2013-10-17 11:47): The typos and lack of professional editting gets somewhat annoying, but I would recommend it to anyone
Mark (2013-10-17 11:49): is there a lot of overlap with this http://therationalmale.com/the-best-of-rational-male-year-one/
Xander (2013-10-17 11:49): Yes
Xander (2013-10-17 11:49): Most of it is lifted from that series
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:50): so where can I find this book
Xander (2013-10-17 11:50): You could probably just read that and get everything you need
Xander (2013-10-17 11:50): But the book is less than $10 and I wanted to support the author, since he helped me so much on my journey
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 11:51): gotcha
Xander (2013-10-17 11:51): I thought of what I'm going to send Dana next. I'm going to text her a picture of a bucolic Indiana-in-Autumn scene, the orange and ochre leaves of the oak trees trembling in anticipation of Jack Frost's arrival.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:52): Also, books are just more badass.
Xander (2013-10-17 11:52): I won't even write a caption for my picture. I'll let her ask the questions
Xander (2013-10-17 11:53): @Philly Phil http://www.amazon.com/The-Rational-Male-Rollo-Tomassi/dp/1492777862
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:06) (1x <3): you know nuclear war scares the shit out of me.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:06): watching videos of the Tsar Bomba
Mark (2013-10-17 12:07): would you like a hug
Xander (2013-10-17 12:07) (1x <3): A vaginal hug
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:07): that'd be nice
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:08): jesus
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:08): http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xui9p2_tsar-bomba-moment-of-explosion_tech
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:09): I mean that could level the entire north east
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 12:58): If you get a girl's number, but you can't see her until like Sunday, do you text her to keep her warm?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 12:58): Or will she not lose interest/ forget about you even if you don't talk for a couple of days
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 12:59): nah you can put her on standby
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 13:00) (1x <3): in my limited experience I think up to a week wouldn't really matter
Xander (2013-10-17 13:01): @Hot Tongs I would send her some occasional random bullshit
Xander (2013-10-17 13:01): Just to tickle her neurons a little
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 13:05): damn trial texts are pretty good
Jimmyayo (2013-10-17 13:11) (1x <3): Marky mark lavo is fire
Jimmyayo (2013-10-17 13:19) (1x <3): Tough door, small venue...ridiculous girls
Jimmyayo (2013-10-17 13:20): Maybe the hottest girls out of any venue, minus maybe Provocateur and 1Oak
Mark (2013-10-17 13:39): hey Jimmy, look who i found
Mark (2013-10-17 13:39) (1x <3): http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Nv3j64jzXreLow_S1G6nYQ
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 13:52): I'm sooo needy I want to go. Haha
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 13:53): Dash berlin is playing there on Nov 7 but tickets sold out quick
Nate (2013-10-17 14:27): You will never find an ugly woman named Gisela
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:35): lol I don't think I've met a woman named that
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 14:38): Its a Latin name. Brazilian I think mostly
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 14:38): Still looking for date spots near 6ave
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 14:38): Ideas?
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:39): https://baybio.org/gisela-schwab/
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:39): gross ugly gisela
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:39): who knows though she might have been a dime back in the day
Nate (2013-10-17 14:42): Damn you phil, dispelling my generalization
Mark (2013-10-17 14:42): i'd hit it
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:42): I mean she is a doctor
Nate (2013-10-17 14:42): Mine was much hotter.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:42): that's pretty sexy
Mark (2013-10-17 14:43): think about all the free physicals you could enjoy
Nate (2013-10-17 14:44) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/10bf5430198a0131c698265421a3834a
Nate (2013-10-17 14:44): I know you guys aren't into older women, but damn...
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:44): yeah I mean
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 14:44): I'd hit it
Nate (2013-10-17 14:45): I plan to
Nate (2013-10-17 14:45): That picture also doesn't do her body justice
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 15:07): From what I see of her body, it looks good
Nate (2013-10-17 15:28) (1x <3): Hence my statement about it not doing her justice
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 16:59): Project NYC  http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/nfb/4135558837.html   only for the RICH
Marky Mark (2013-10-17 16:59): hahah
Nate (2013-10-17 17:12): dead link
Nate (2013-10-17 17:51): Hmm, the girl who flaked on me Tuesday just called.  Didn't pick up.  Left a message said she was out of town and under the weather.  Said she still wants to 'hook up', and if I'm free, since I'm the busy one, let her know...
Nate (2013-10-17 17:51): Good sign.
Nate (2013-10-17 17:52): I'll call her back tomorrow, say I'm busy this weekend (rightly).  Set up a time for next week, and say she's buying.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:36): okay
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:36): I'm definitely in the mood to blow up all my old sets and start new
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:36): or at least experiment with them
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:36): I'm definitely not ready to be out of the game yet
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:36): at least for the type of girl I want
Nate (2013-10-17 18:37): I'm ready to play with my new numbers from the last couple days.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:37): nice
Nate (2013-10-17 18:37): Gonna play with texting
Nate (2013-10-17 18:37): "Don't think about me......too late"
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:38): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/c99a8ce019aa0131562d4ad9fde0af2d
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:38): I like the one word thing
Nate (2013-10-17 18:39): Yeah that one is pretty damn cool
Nate (2013-10-17 18:39): I would have said "Maybe"
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:39): well I figured we haven't met yet
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:39): so I said yes
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:39): I was going to go with "We'll see"
Nate (2013-10-17 18:39): Fair point
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:40): but yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:41): anyway reading all this text game stuff is giving me good ideas on how to improve my mid game
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:41): and to stop giving a shit
Nate (2013-10-17 18:41): Just the stuff Xander sent us in that email, or other things?
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:41): texted a girl "Made bread last night" as a feeler text
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:42): this is liz my absolute fav
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:42): haven't texted her since last friday
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:42): just the Xander stuff btw
Nate (2013-10-17 18:42): Yeah I've been reading it today
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:42): I almost read all of it
Nate (2013-10-17 18:42): About 2/3 for me
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:42): gotcha
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:43): I like to read things twice too
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:43): so I might do that
Nate (2013-10-17 18:43): Yeah, might look at some other stuff like braddocks text game, and another one I have somewhere
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:44): mm yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:44): I think its definitely my weakest point but one of the easiest to improve
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:44): because you really have infinite time to think about what the fuck to say
Nate (2013-10-17 18:45): Fair point.  Good texting is very alien to me tho
Nate (2013-10-17 18:45): Once the theory is down tho, yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 18:45): mm
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:09): Hey can you fuck a girl on a Saturday midday date?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:10): Like.. If you go out at night drinks>rooftop>apt I can see that.. But I wouldn't know how midday works
Nate (2013-10-17 19:10): The answer to any question of that nature is yes
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:10): But like during the day arnt most dates out and about?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:11): Less chance they'd have the mindset to fuck?
Nate (2013-10-17 19:11): Possible and easy aren't the same thing either
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:12): So it's possible but not as easy?
Nate (2013-10-17 19:13): Sure
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:14): Hmm damn seems like a waste of time lol
Nate (2013-10-17 19:14): It's only a waste of time if you're a quitter
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:19): What do you mean?
Nate (2013-10-17 19:19): I mean it's only a waste of time if you don't attempt it and assume it's going to fail before you even try.
Nate (2013-10-17 19:20): People do crazier things all the time
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:20): H&m ok say we meet at sat at 3.. I don't even know what people do at that time
Nate (2013-10-17 19:21): Go to a park, take a walk across the bridge.  Fuck, just get a drink.  People drink in the afternoon.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:22): hm i think im reluctant because our interaction wasn't that long
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:23): and i dont know if well be interested for that long
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:23): need exit plan
Nate (2013-10-17 19:23): Unless the date has a time limit, you can do something day-like, then get a drink, then whatever
Nate (2013-10-17 19:23): Exit plan is easy.  Make up something and say you have to be there.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:23): do you think going to bryant park is lame?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:24): ooh highline
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:24): yes thats perf
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:24) (2x <3): highline>grab a bite> rooftop> bed
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:24): lol

Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 19:27): lolol
Nate (2013-10-17 20:29): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/37cc828019ba0131562d4ad9fde0af2d
Nate (2013-10-17 20:29): Should I change the subject or call her on it
Nate (2013-10-17 20:29): Like "Hah, nice try.  It was only yesterday and I'm memorable"
Hot Tongs (2013-10-17 20:39) (1x <3): Haha you're feisty
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 20:59): That's a tough one nate
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 20:59): Maybe ignore
Nate (2013-10-17 21:00): Too late, I sent it about 2 minutes ago. lol
Nate (2013-10-17 21:02): I don't like braddocks text manual.
Philly Phil (2013-10-17 22:14): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ef8f02d019c80131f2715ee715c3c86f

Philly Phil (2013-10-17 23:24): What would be a good recovery
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 00:18): "fishing for a compliment ;)" maybe without the winky
Mark (2013-10-18 00:20) (1x <3): more of you to love
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 00:21): lol okay sent
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 05:12): Commands and one word texts are my favorite
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 05:13): Wow that date took forever too much Fucking not Fucking
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 05:14) (1x <3): 8 to 5am . really. At one point she was on my bed in Newport jersey city, and on another I was fingerings her on the 1 train going to her place in Harlem.
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 05:17) (1x <3): This girl wants a Fucking bf, told me if I want to be her bf she is mine. Haha. Also she talked about me not paying for her first drink for 2 hours haha.
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 05:19) (1x <3): She told me bc it's the first date I need to have bought the first drink. Load of bs.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:33): halp
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:34): Me: thats
 good, because it looked like you really like sex from the couple of 
nights we spent together. i want to see you again, do you have any more 
vacation days?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:34): N: I'm
 glad you said you want us to see each other again before me. I didn't 
want to look like a naive or hysterical girl...
Well, I think there is no point in hidding things. I spent a very good 
time with you, sexually or not.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:34) (1x <3): N:We had a good time in bed, we both felt 
it, right?  But since I'm back to France, to me, it doesn't look like 
just a sexual attraction. Despite I'm French, there seems to be a 
general good connexion, doesn't it?
So me too, I'd like to see you again. I have some vacation days left to 
take between now and next May. And you, could you seriously think about 
visiting me here or me, to come again?
Nate (2013-10-18 09:37): Seems like as good a reason as any to take a nice trip to France...
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:39): would this be a good response or too eager/needy?
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:40): 


Hi N, I do feel a connection with you and would like to
see where this could go. I’m a little naïve myself, and maybe that’s why we’ll
be a good match.





I've always wanted to go backpacking in Europe, so maybe I visit you. Because
of my job, I probably won’t be able to come until around Christmas time. In the
meanwhile, would you want to take another trip to NY?
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 09:57): good morning
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 09:57): sounds like a sweet deal @Hot Tongs
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 09:58) (1x <3): I'd say that's a decent response you don't have to play too many games with europeans
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 09:59): ooh okay thanks
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 09:59): so who's going to the meetup
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:00): I haven't made up my mind yet but I could be convinced
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:00): to go...
Nate (2013-10-18 10:03): Got a date tonight 85% confirmed.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:06): ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:07): I kind of don't want to go but I do want to game
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:16): I actually do want to go, but got a family dinner
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:16): Actually won't be able to do very much this whole week w/ my parents in town  =(
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 10:18): i dont think i'm going to go
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 10:19): When and where is it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:20): Sigh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:20): http://www.reddit.com/r/GothamSeddit/comments/1ogx9t/gotham_seddit_meetup_friday_october_18th_2013/
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:20): Bleeker Street Bar @ 8pm
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:21): It's MTB's last meetup I guess
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:22): I don't really even know that guy
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:22): and when I did meet him I thought he was fucking weird
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 10:22): I never met him
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:22): He's really not too bad in real life, we get along 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:22): He's just a dick on the chat
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:22): But he said the same thing about me, so
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:23): I meant awkward more than weird
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:23): ah
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:23): well w/e I've got all day to think about it
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:23): I restructured my spreadsheet and exed more women
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:23) (1x <3): I need more active leads now
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:24) (1x <3): Philly Phil - I think that's a good place to be mentally.  Hungry for more women
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:25): yeaa
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:25): Something that has plagued me was the whole "abundance mindset" thing.  I know it's supposed to be a good thing to have...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:25): But it can make you really unmotivated to go out, approach women, etc
Nate (2013-10-18 10:27): My impression of MTB was I didn't believe he was a pua
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:27): He's pretty chill.  he's got pretty decent game from what I've seen
Nate (2013-10-18 10:28): @jimmy actually having abundance is a good thing.  It means your getting what you want.  If that's not what you want then you don't have abundance.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:29): In general I agree...abundance mentality helps
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:30): I'm just saying it can also make you unmotivated to game more chicks
Nate (2013-10-18 10:30) (1x <3): If you're happy with what you have, isn't that basically the point?
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:32): just ex the women you're not as satisfied with
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:32): then you'll have less and want to game more
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:32): Are you ever truly happy w/ what you have in terms of women when you're in pickup?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:32) (1x <3): I think it's a hunger that is never fully satiated
Nate (2013-10-18 10:32) (1x <3): @jimmy depends on why you're in this
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:33): if I met the right chick
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:34) (1x <3): and we had great chemistry I would get out of the game and I think I would be happier then
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:35): its just a means to an end for me
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:35): I also have fun with it
Nate (2013-10-18 10:35): @Phil if your happiness depends on finding the right chick, you should also start looking closer at yourself and what you really need for happiness
Nate (2013-10-18 10:36) (1x <3): As someone who's said that a long time, I realized that wasn't the cause or lack of cause of my happiness
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:37): oh bad phrasing on my part
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:37): I'm happy now
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:37): but that's a good thing to think about anyway
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:37): That's great Phil
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:38) (1x <3): It's sort of a catch-22 for me at the moment...it's so hard for me to fall in love w/ a girl anymore
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:38): I know I won't be happy long-term banging multiple sluts
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:38): Yet I can't just settle down w/ 1 chick either
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:39): I'M DOOOOOOOOMED
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:39): you just haven't met the right girl
Nate (2013-10-18 10:39): I see my cousins who have been married for 70 years, and I want the connection they have.  Eventually.
Nate (2013-10-18 10:39): I'm not ready for that yet though.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:39): yeah same ^ but when I'm over 30
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:39): ^ I'm over 30  =(
Nate (2013-10-18 10:39): SO am I
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:40): and there's that
Nate (2013-10-18 10:40): But I lost out a lot of time in my life, so I feel I need to make up for that first.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:41): hm
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:41): I mean I feel like the best mind set to get into is one of zero caring of what happens
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:42): until you reach a point of no return with one girl
Nate (2013-10-18 10:42): I think that if I found the right girl, I'm still not good enough at this to keep her.  I still get needy too easily.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:43): yeah I mean maybe
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:43): I'm too much pull too early but then fine later
Nate (2013-10-18 10:44): I mean you never know, but I haven't met anyone who comes close to that for many months.
Nate (2013-10-18 10:44): So no rush
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:44): jesus and you meet so many women
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:44): I've only had a smattering of success the past couple weeks
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:45): and I already met two chicks I would date
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:45): but then I fucked it up
Nate (2013-10-18 10:45): I meet women who could fit all the time, but they are nearly always with someone, because the kind of woman I want to marry has a personality that doesn't close her off to people.
Nate (2013-10-18 10:46): The last single girl I met who fit was at the beginning of the summer, and I fucked it up
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:47): damn
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:47): that kind of shit happens too often
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:47): the next cool girl I meet I'm not going to fuck up
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:48): I'm getting careless
Nate (2013-10-18 10:48): I probably will, but I'm patient and still fairly new to this stuff
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:48): yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:48): I mean I wouldn't describe you that way
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:48): you don't give yourself enough credit
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:48): In what way(s) do you think you guys are fucking it up? 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:49): Getting too attached?  
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:49): Too much asshole game?
Nate (2013-10-18 10:49): getting too attached.  I'm still not enough of an asshole
Nate (2013-10-18 10:50): When I meet the right kind of girl, I know it pretty quick, and my mind starts seeing us together in 50 years.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:50): yah I'm definitely not enough of an asshole and I get way too into her if I like her
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:50): oh I don't go that far
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:50): lol
Nate (2013-10-18 10:50): :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:50): haha different periods of our lives
Nate (2013-10-18 10:51): Yeah :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:51): :)
Nate (2013-10-18 10:51): I've always been a closet romantic though.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:51): haha I am sort of
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:51) (1x <3): I used to be way more but I grew out of it
Nate (2013-10-18 10:51) (1x <3): Well yeah I'm vastly better than I used to be, and getting better by the day
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:52) (1x <3): damn right ^
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:52): oh nice I'm going to get to see my dutch girl in december
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:52): she just won a trip to nyc
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:52) (2x <3): I think it's good to retain that romantic side of you...just need to save it for the right girl and at the right time
Nate (2013-10-18 10:53): @jimmy yeah
Nate (2013-10-18 10:53) (1x <3): For now, tonight I just wanna bang the fuck out of Lidiane
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:54) (1x <3): How romantic  =)
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:54): lmao
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:54): my last gf I made her dinner and we ate outside under the stars by candle light on one of our first dates
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:54): Great weather today, gonna do some daygame at lunch
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:54): that was pretty romantic
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:54): Oh wow
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 10:55): then I banged her in my shitty room
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:56): My last gf, we both dressed up real nice, I took us to the 21 club for dinner, then the opera, then we took our shoes off, rolled up our trousers/dress and waded through the fountain @ columbus circle wishing well
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:56): Our 2nd (or 3rd?) week together we flew to Paris 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 10:57): Dam I miss doing that kinda stuff
Nate (2013-10-18 10:57): That's what you miss doing this stuff, really doing things with a girl together
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:01): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0b23dc901a340131a14a66521f9b3c34
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:01): the girl on the right is my ex
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:01): that I lived with and dated for more than 2 years
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:02): I always thought she was about a 7
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:02): maybe a high 7 at times
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 11:02): Do you miss her?
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:03): a little
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:03): but not really
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:03): I more miss how easy that whole situation was
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:03): than her
Xander (2013-10-18 11:15): I knew it. You guys have become beta in my absence
Nate (2013-10-18 11:15) (2x <3): We're all planning to go to a bar tonight and buy women drinks
Xander (2013-10-18 11:17) (1x <3): @Nate Me too, but only ones spiked with rohypnol
Xander (2013-10-18 11:17): You could say that I've had a little change of heart in terms of buying drinks for women
Nate (2013-10-18 11:18): Leave it to Xander to turn the conversation creep
Nate (2013-10-18 11:18): y
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 11:18): We missed you
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:18): buy them a roofie colada
Xander (2013-10-18 11:19) (1x <3): I'm planning on creeping hardcore on my college's campus today. There's sure to be some freshmeat, err, I mean freshmen hotties
Xander (2013-10-18 11:22): I'm going to see if I can creep shot them too
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:22): get some Contro shots for us
Xander (2013-10-18 11:24): I'm glad there are so many Japanese exchange students here, since I have a special place in my heart for Asian women
Xander (2013-10-18 11:26): They be lighting my soul ablaze with relentless desire
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:31): On a date, does a guy have to buy a girl the first drink.
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:31): I call bs on that
Nate (2013-10-18 11:32): No, but I usually do anyway
Mark (2013-10-18 11:32) (2x <3): i usually say ill get the first round, they get the second
Mark (2013-10-18 11:33) (1x <3): then go for beer for the first round and cocktails for the second
Mark (2013-10-18 11:33) (1x <3): they fall for it every time
Nate (2013-10-18 11:33): I usually don't bring it up
Nate (2013-10-18 11:33): Or I just say "Get this round, I'll have a whatever"
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:34): This girl yesterday gave a lot of shit about not buying the first round
Nate (2013-10-18 11:34): What culture was she from?
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:34): *gave me
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:34): White
Mark (2013-10-18 11:34) (1x <3): usually girls from former USSR countries expect guys to pay for all drinks
Mark (2013-10-18 11:34): in my experience
Nate (2013-10-18 11:35) (3x <3): It's also your fault for responding to her when she kept whining about it
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:36): Girls in Europe told me it's weird American guys buy us drinks like crazy. Here (stockholm) if a guy buys me a drink it mean I'm going home with him
Mark (2013-10-18 11:36) (2x <3): if she complains, my response is usually something like 'it's the 21st century, don't you believe in equality?'
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:36): Mark that's what I kinda said.
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:36): I talked about equality
Nate (2013-10-18 11:37) (1x <3): Yeah but I saw your FR last night, you let her whine for 2 hrs about it.  After about 5 minutes I just wouldn't entertain the question anymore
Mark (2013-10-18 11:37) (1x <3): don't have a discussion, just brush it off with a smirk
Mark (2013-10-18 11:37) (1x <3): change topics
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:37) (1x <3): I tried mark and nate, she brought it up in two different bars
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 11:40) (4x <3): Then she's a cunt
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:43): Yup I believe so, I did start ignoring her heavy
Nate (2013-10-18 11:44) (1x <3): @Mark at some point if she's annoying you enough.  Shut her ass down.  Tell her youre not talking about that anymore.  Pull out your phone and start browsing the web in front of her.
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:44): And she started kissing my neck to get my attention
Nate (2013-10-18 11:44): Sounds good to me
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:45): Yea. I think she just got very drunk. We did finish a bottle. Of wine in less than a 45mins
Nate (2013-10-18 11:47) (3x <3): What I didn't understand is once you got her to your place, why did you leave with her to go to hers?
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:47): Haha
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-18 11:49): Mark changed name to Archer
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:49): Got her to my place, try to have sex. She gave to much resistance. Tried over and over, as I tried more and more resistance grow. So i was fuck this, let's go back to the city
Archer (2013-10-18 11:50) (1x <3): sounds like you pulled too much, and didn't push enough
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:50): True.
Archer (2013-10-18 11:50) (2x <3): get her worked up and be the one to end it/pull away
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:50): I started pushing too late
Nate (2013-10-18 11:50) (3x <3): Archer: I was literally writing the exact same sentence as you
Archer (2013-10-18 11:51) (2x <3): something like 'you really gotta go, i have to get up early in the morning'
Archer (2013-10-18 11:51) (3x <3): or 'this is going too fast for me'
Archer (2013-10-18 11:52): with a cheeky smile of course
Nate (2013-10-18 11:52): Or just stop, back off, chat for a few minutes, and start up again slowly
Nate (2013-10-18 11:52) (1x <3): Say all the lmr bullshit before the girl does
Archer (2013-10-18 11:53) (1x <3): yeah just showing some restraint separates you from 90% of all other guys
Nate (2013-10-18 11:54) (1x <3): Leaving your place just made you look beta
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 11:55): Nate I agree. That move was very beta
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:55): next time I get into that with a girl I'm definitely showing some restraint
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:56): but only if I think she's hot enough
Nate (2013-10-18 11:58): If she's not hot enough why is she even at your place.  Besides I like foreplay
Nate (2013-10-18 11:59): A couple hours of push-pull making her hot is fun.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:59): well i she's hot enough that I would want to wait
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 11:59): otherwise I would just bang her
Nate (2013-10-18 11:59): For me banging her has no bearing on whether I want to see her again
Nate (2013-10-18 12:00) (1x <3): Unless I think she's too conservative and I don't feel like waiting any more
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:02): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8e9dba901a3c0131a14a66521f9b3c34
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:02) (3x <3): you look evil
Nate (2013-10-18 12:06): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/257f8df01a3d0131a14a66521f9b3c34
Nate (2013-10-18 12:06): I still text too much, but it worked out
Nate (2013-10-18 12:07): I'm thinking of writing "I might work there, in the secret headquarters of the NSA, whoops I told you"
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:09): Haha
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:09): I am evil
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:10): hmm @nate she's a tough cookie
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:10): plus I hate girls that can't write proper english
Xander (2013-10-18 12:10): Damn...
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:11): you might want to push more
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:11): a lot more
Nate (2013-10-18 12:11): @phil she's japanese
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:11): hmm
Xander (2013-10-18 12:11): Meeting girl in the middle for lunch date at 1pm ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/dae0f1101a3d0131dd2222a2f8672932
Nate (2013-10-18 12:11): Why what would you say?
Nate (2013-10-18 12:12) (2x <3): @Xander nice, I like big lips and big tits
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:12): I'm not sure
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:12) (1x <3): I wouldn't answer her question
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 12:13) (2x <3): I'd say "why are you gonna stalk me like the last girl that asked me that?"
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:14): not bad ^
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 12:14) (1x <3): or just "why are you gonna stalk me"
Nate (2013-10-18 12:15) (1x <3): That works for me, although I'm gonna wait till later today to text her
Xander (2013-10-18 12:15): Y u txt so much Nate
Nate (2013-10-18 12:15): @Xander I dunno.  Compulsion.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:15): that second text could have been "lets meet for a drink"
Nate (2013-10-18 12:17): yeah
Nate (2013-10-18 12:17): well I'm not bringing up drinks again till it's actually next week.  For the moment I'm just texting her for practice
Xander (2013-10-18 12:17) (3x <3): Send her a picture of your junk
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:18): loll
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:18): I've never actually done that
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 12:18) (3x <3): My phone would need incredible zoom
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:18): I don't think even the android monsters would be big enough
Xander (2013-10-18 12:20): I think you guys are still putting a little too much effort into your texts
Xander (2013-10-18 12:20): They should be the textual equivalent of grunts
Nate (2013-10-18 12:21): So I should talk like a caveman "walls good"
Nate (2013-10-18 12:22): @Xander all the guides on the internet to the theory behind texting are total shit
Nate (2013-10-18 12:22): The links you sent were good, although a lot of texts were crappy examples with good commentary
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:23): that can be just as helpful
Nate (2013-10-18 12:24): Sometimes
Nate (2013-10-18 12:24): I'm studying them either way
Nate (2013-10-18 12:24): Braddocks guide was pretty crap
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:24): oh damn I have 150,000 life insurance
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:24): I didn't even know
Nate (2013-10-18 12:25): ooh ooh, make me the beneficiary
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 12:25) (1x <3): done and done
Xander (2013-10-18 12:25): Meh
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:27): Xander was the girl in my picture the one that Richard pulled on tuesday
Xander (2013-10-18 12:31): I believe so, if she's the one from Wisconsin
Nate (2013-10-18 12:32): So you shared a girl?
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:32): Yup
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:32): Thought so
Nate (2013-10-18 12:32): So she put out for him, she can put out for you :)
Xander (2013-10-18 12:33): He didn't do anything with her. Couldn't even kiss her
Nate (2013-10-18 12:33): Ahh
Xander (2013-10-18 12:33): Is this the girl that you finger blasted on the PATH?
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:34): It was on the 1 subway
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 12:34): Just talked on the path

Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 13:14): so if this french girl is planning to come down to visit, should i offer to pay for half the ticket?
Nate (2013-10-18 13:15) (1x <3): No, and you shouldn't ask her to pay for yours when you fly there
Nate (2013-10-18 13:16): just my opinion tho
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 13:20) (1x <3): Yeah def no for paying for half her ticket
Hot Tongs (2013-10-18 13:20): chivalry?
Nate (2013-10-18 13:22): doormat?
Nate (2013-10-18 13:31) (2x <3): You need to start putting your needs first.  It's an important part of success in this.
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 13:32) (4x <3): White knight syndrome
Nate (2013-10-18 13:51): I love working from home, movie time!
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 14:08): No to paying anything for women
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 14:47): Anyone up for miami in December
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:03) (1x <3): @Hot Tongs I imagine she's staying with you if she comes for a visit?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:03): So you'd be saving her $$ for lodging
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:06): Just came back from some daygaming
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:06): Was a good day
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:06): 4 approaches
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:07): 2 numbers but 1 has a live-in bf, I know I'm not getting anywhere w/ that one.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:08): 1 she just said thanks and walked away lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:08): Last one also had a bf
Nate (2013-10-18 15:11): Really hot girls, especially ones with bf's usually say thanks and walk away
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 15:14): that was fun
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 15:15): only one approach
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 15:15): she was married but it was a good set

Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 15:23): I find the asian one more attractive
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 15:24): its hard to tell from behind
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 15:25): I saw so many gorgeous girls from behind who then turned out to be 40

Philly Phil (2013-10-18 16:21): yep
Nate (2013-10-18 16:22): I bet every day LTD goes home, sits there and watches tv, and tries to figure out why he's getting nowhere.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 16:25): True
Nate (2013-10-18 16:25): Although my berating probably isn't helping...
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 16:25): Telling him to find another apt and another job isn't really gonna help either
Nate (2013-10-18 16:26): Yeah I know
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 16:26): he's the only one that can help him
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 16:26): at this point
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 16:26): I felt bad for him...it was like everybody was ganging up on him and telling him "man the fuck up u pussy shit"
Nate (2013-10-18 16:26): And most of those people were almost as bad too
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 16:27): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-18 16:36): What are Clojures doing this wknd?

Xander (2013-10-18 17:07): I can't even stomach the thought of looking at GayLife after reading your commentary here
Nate (2013-10-18 17:08): @Xander I went a little apeshit on ltd
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 17:08): Im going to leave the group tonight
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 17:08): after the meetup
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 17:09): I dont look at it anymore. Maybe I should stay and just check it once every week 
Nate (2013-10-18 17:09) (3x <3): Every once in a while I go on there to fluff my own ego, but listening to advice there will only hurt me
Marky Mark (2013-10-18 17:09): hahah
Xander (2013-10-18 17:34) (2x <3): It's psychologically unhealthy to spend any significant time reading that group
Xander (2013-10-18 17:39): At this point, I wouldn't willingly choose anyone else in that chat as a wing
Nate (2013-10-18 17:40) (3x <3): Maybe Timex
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 17:40) (1x <3): Timex is a cool kat
Nate (2013-10-18 17:40): I actually think he deserves to be here

Nate (2013-10-18 17:42): and he's cool
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 17:42): I've never seen him approach but I know he does
Nate (2013-10-18 17:43): I've seen him approach, and hung out with him while he made out with a girl all night in front of her 6 girlfriends
Philly Phil (2013-10-18 17:43): damn sorry I missed that
Nate (2013-10-18 17:43): Was fun
Xander (2013-10-18 17:44): Yeah, I second the vote for TimeX. I've run game with him a couple times, good dude

Nick S (2013-10-18 19:26): I don't think I would be able to schedule that many dates nj one week. 2 max probably

Nate (2013-10-19 09:51): Breakfast time!
Nate (2013-10-19 09:53) (2x <3): My date was great.  Took her to Sushi, then back to my place and fucked her.
Nate (2013-10-19 10:05) (1x <3): Aaand I number closed a girl on the way to the grocery store who basically said she didn't want a boyfriend, but wants to go out with me.  Pretty much code for 'just sex please thanks'
Nate (2013-10-19 10:11) (1x <3): I'm doing really well handling LMR lately
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:28): @nate teach ur magic
Nate (2013-10-19 10:28): 3 things helped me
Nate (2013-10-19 10:29) (2x <3): 1. Lots of Push-Pull - Whenever she showed any resistance I went back a couple steps and took things slow
Nate (2013-10-19 10:29) (2x <3): 2. She said "This is too soon", I said "I don't know why I feel very comfortable with you, it's like I've known you for years"
Nate (2013-10-19 10:30) (2x <3): 3. I pulled out my cock.
Nate (2013-10-19 10:30) (1x <3): The last one knocked down the last of her resistance.  She grabbed it and started jerking me off and it was on.
Nate (2013-10-19 10:32) (1x <3): Also during my other time with her I did plenty of kino and established I was comfortable with sex
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:38): I have been debating #3
Nate (2013-10-19 10:38): Every single time I've done it, it has been very beneficial
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:39): Its high risk high reward
Nate (2013-10-19 10:39) (1x <3): Almost no risk at all
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:39): Based on ur success rate
Nate (2013-10-19 10:39) (2x <3): I don't do it until after I've felt her up and made out a bunch, and usually seen her tits
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:40): I like
Nate (2013-10-19 10:40): If she doesn't grab it, I start making out with her again, and then put her hand on it
Nate (2013-10-19 10:41) (2x <3): The key is not to react like it's a big deal at all.
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:43) (2x <3): Yeah my down fall is my big mouth. I talk too much, need to shut up and just let it happen
Nate (2013-10-19 10:43) (1x <3): Yeah it's much harder to talk when your tongue is down her throat
Nate (2013-10-19 10:47): Yeah at one point she said "We should watch tv, put on a movie".  I said "Okay", and then started making out with her again.
Marky Mark (2013-10-19 10:51): BEAST Nate
Nate (2013-10-19 10:54) (1x <3): Roar
Xander (2013-10-19 12:23) (2x <3): Well, I spent last night in bed with a mother of three
Xander (2013-10-19 12:27) (1x <3): Basically went around to a bunch of parties, realized that stupid college kids were giving me shit for working somewhere other than a non-profit, started getting drunk and very belligerent, then left and had sex with a hot townie
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:37) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/abfd4d101b0a013154bd5201918926ed

Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:38): Damn Xander
Xander (2013-10-19 12:41): Yeah, I forgot how much I hated the people from my college. Idealistic idiots
Xander (2013-10-19 12:42): Girl says "don't you think you're adding to the problem?" When she finds out I make apps. Sorry I don't run an urban garden for underprivileged marsupials or whatever
Xander (2013-10-19 12:44): Then some other girl demands to know what I think I'm doing by having my arm around her friend's shoulders. Girl wasn't even hot, I was just enjoying the party
Xander (2013-10-19 12:45) (1x <3): I told her, "I'm pretty sure she would have told me to take my arm off of her shoulders sometime in the past 5 minutes if she had been uncomfortable with it" That bitch really didn't like it when I said that, haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:52): That's nuts man
Xander (2013-10-19 12:52): Doesn't feminists acting as if females have zero autonomy and responsibility for themselves strike you as, well... sexist?
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:53): Haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:53): Dude what should I say to this tinder bitch
Xander (2013-10-19 12:53): Oh, I tinder number closed yesterday
Xander (2013-10-19 12:54): We're meeting for a drink on Monday
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:54): Nice I feel like I don't meet many feminists like that
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 12:54): In ny
Xander (2013-10-19 12:56) (1x <3): That's because feminism is for uggos
Archer (2013-10-19 13:21) (1x <3): Phil got cockblocked by a feminazi bush hog last night
Philly Phil (2013-10-19 13:25): Lol it was pretty hard core

Mark (2013-10-19 15:19): expectations were met
Nate (2013-10-19 15:25): If I wanna start charging for shit, it's a gold mine
Nate (2013-10-19 15:29): @Mark any cool people?
Mark (2013-10-19 15:34): a few, but we didn't stay long
Mark (2013-10-19 15:34): wasn't quite sober either, it's all a blur

Nate (2013-10-20 18:22): Haha
Xander (2013-10-20 19:44) (5x <3): I can't believe I'm leaving Indiana this late... If I die on the road tonight guys, just know that it was an honor to run game with you finest of gentlemen
Nate (2013-10-20 22:33) (2x <3): Back from my date, way too conservative for me.
Nate (2013-10-20 22:35): Gorgeous, but wierd too
Nate (2013-10-20 22:37): and not in a good way
Mark (2013-10-20 23:28): back
Mark (2013-10-20 23:29) (1x <3): this girl was a demon in the sack
Mark (2013-10-20 23:30): sorry to hear about your night Nate, i think you should stop dating Japanese women
Nate (2013-10-20 23:30): Actually she was Chinese... Oops
Mark (2013-10-20 23:30): same shit
Nate (2013-10-20 23:30): Pretty much
Mark (2013-10-20 23:31): met a girl on my way back home

Nate (2013-10-20 23:36): Cool
Nate (2013-10-20 23:37): and you said you couldn't approach alone :)
Mark (2013-10-20 23:38) (1x <3): i actually think i do better alone... i can't take refuge in conversation with you folks
Mark (2013-10-20 23:39) (1x <3): maybe when i've done more i'll be able to handle both scenarios
Nate (2013-10-21 10:27): Morning
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 10:34): Good morning
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 10:35) (1x <3): I'm going to work late @mark I was at the dmv
Mark (2013-10-21 10:36): im taking like 4 day weekends lately... Fri/Mon at home
Mark (2013-10-21 10:37): wonder when my boss will find out... or if he even cares
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:32): Okay I had an off week but I'm back in the saddle
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:32): made some hardcore goals this week and I'm going to stick to them
Nate (2013-10-21 11:32): Riding a girl on a saddle, check!
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:33): I've always wanted to do that
Nate (2013-10-21 11:33): Some day I will
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:33): I'm way too heavy
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:33): I'd need a beast of a woman
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:33): I weigh 200 pounds
Nate (2013-10-21 11:33): Naah, just a fit one of decent height
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:34) (2x <3): and a riding crop
Nate (2013-10-21 11:35): It's funny, my date last night was lame, and I really didn't care.  Knowing you have more scheduled already really takes the edge off.
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:35): yep
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:35): I had a lame date recently
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:36) (1x <3): I just sent out the best OKC message I think I've ever sent
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:36): or response rather she messaged me
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:37): I don't message girls anymore too much work
Nate (2013-10-21 11:38): Mine was very conservative, uncomfortable talking about kissing much less doing it, and obsessively patted her forehead with a tissue all night
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:38): um
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:38): obsessively patting her forehead
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:39): ?
Nate (2013-10-21 11:48): It was slightly warm and she was constantly trying not to sweat on her forehead.  WIERD
Nate (2013-10-21 11:48): Really hot girl tho
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:52): hot girl you say ... hm might be worth the conservativeness
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 11:53): but maybe not
Nate (2013-10-21 11:55): Quite hot, but unless I think I can break her walls, not worth it
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:00): I'm dropping some solid advice in gay life
Nate (2013-10-21 12:07): Layin down the law
Nate (2013-10-21 12:08) (1x <3): Noone is willing to actually try my advice.  It's too much work for the average lazy chump
Nate (2013-10-21 12:14): ^ trolling is fun
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:15): lol
Xander (2013-10-21 12:26): I'm not sure I'm every logging back in, except to tell everyone about my texting bootcamps
Xander (2013-10-21 12:26): *ever
Nate (2013-10-21 12:27): I'm planning to open today with 2 chicks: "I had a dream last night that I was a disney secret agent"
Nate (2013-10-21 12:27): via text
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:27): bye Xander
Nate (2013-10-21 12:27): I never know what to open with :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:27): yeah same ^
Nate (2013-10-21 12:28): It's actually true tho, I was a secret agent trying to free a princess from a crystal cell
Nate (2013-10-21 12:28) (1x <3): and I freed her by kissing her
Nate (2013-10-21 12:28): My dream life is interesting
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:28): I had a dream I was sucking on the tits of this ecuadorian girl I met a few months back
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:29): she had the tiniest tits ever
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:29): fun though
Nate (2013-10-21 12:29): Her name was Nipple
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:30): lol your dream is more entertaining
Nate (2013-10-21 12:31): Yeah there was quite a bit of action, I should write a screenplay and sell it to Disney.
Nate (2013-10-21 12:31): There was a train chase scene, and a gunfight, and some psychic powers thrown in
Nate (2013-10-21 12:31) (1x <3): Gunfight would probably need to be changed to swordfight for disney
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:32): nice! I love dreams where a lot of shit goes down
Xander (2013-10-21 12:35): GayLife doesn't deserve my presence.
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:37): probably not
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:37): I'll stick around though
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:37): and be a god among mortals
Nate (2013-10-21 12:39) (1x <3): I like to brag about my exploits, keeps me humble...
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:41): so I had an idea this week
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:41): every day I'm going to do one thing for me
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:42): like go to the gym or read something not pick up related
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:42): or play music whatever
Nate (2013-10-21 12:43): Good plan
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 12:49): yeah man
Nate (2013-10-21 14:49): This was a night game pull right Phil?
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 14:49): day game
Nate (2013-10-21 14:49): Ahh
Nate (2013-10-21 14:50): day game = best chicks
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 14:50): yes yes yes ^
Mark (2013-10-21 16:18): http://splitsider.com/2013/10/improv-as-a-religion/
Nate (2013-10-21 16:19): Improv is fun and great for pickup
Mark (2013-10-21 16:21): once my language classes end, im going to take one

Marky Mark (2013-10-21 20:32): Wow really I can't believe it.
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 20:33): @phil & @nate wow you guys rocked on gaylife
Xander (2013-10-21 20:34): Stop tempting me. I swore off that accursed place!
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 20:43): Haha it was pretty good today just bc of them
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 20:44): Did u take a nap
Xander (2013-10-21 20:45): Yes. I still feel like shit and I'm sick
Xander (2013-10-21 20:46): Alright, I'm about to log in. I have nothing better to do except update my girl spreadsheet
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 20:46) (1x <3): Do ugly chick on tinder understand they look uglier next to a hot girl
Xander (2013-10-21 21:00) (1x <3): Here I come, nuckas
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 21:05) (1x <3): Nothing is there now. Read the history if you come in
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 21:22) (1x <3): Xander going full force on gaylife
Xander (2013-10-21 21:46): Well, it looks as if I'm shit-out-of-luck in terms of a place to live next month
Xander (2013-10-21 21:47): Time to start looking for a nice cardboard box
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 21:50) (1x <3): Haha
Xander (2013-10-21 22:06): ... because of Clojures.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:25): When/where are you moving, Marky Mark?
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:26): Need a little cash to pay for two places for a month.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:26): Huh?
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:27): My apartment building told me they can rent my place out within 30days from when I leave it.
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:27): But I have to pay until they rent it out
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:30): If you find something, send me the links
Xander (2013-10-21 22:30): @Marky Mark Where are you trying to move, Newport area?
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:31): Out of newport, into city
Xander (2013-10-21 22:31): Good
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:31): Something lower than 40th
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:32): No Chinatown, or below
Xander (2013-10-21 22:32): Obvi
Xander (2013-10-21 22:32): @Marky Mark East Village?
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:33): So les, es, ws, midtown(will pay more for that), Murry hill, hells kitchen (if cheap).. And someothers
Xander (2013-10-21 22:34): Alright, that gives me a good idea
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:34): If i can find something on 4th and 12th plus or minus 5 streets, 2aves that would be great.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:36): I fucked up. I should have taken this dirt cheap room that Nilay was offering me, but I let my pride get in the way. Putting up with him would have been worth it
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:36): Haha.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:37): So now R. Schmitty is moving in
Xander (2013-10-21 22:37): Fuuuuuuck
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:37): Dude that's sweet. They go great together.
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:38): Find something cheap, and I can move sooner than later.
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:39): Yo like I said I can rent u my living room until we find something.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:39): lol, I'm down
Xander (2013-10-21 22:40): Alright, I'm gonna start wading through craigslist
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:43): I was doing that earlier.
Xander (2013-10-21 22:44): Guhhh
Xander (2013-10-21 22:44): I have a date tomorrow with my Dream Girl
Xander (2013-10-21 22:44): And then one on Wednesday with a Tinder bitch
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:45): Haha dream girl. Dont wake up
Xander (2013-10-21 22:46): lol
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 22:47): Just finished date with really sweet girl. Said I was lucky cus she doesn't kiss on the first date.. I'm almost tempted to play her game cus she's so sweet. Is this a bad thing?
Xander (2013-10-21 22:47): Never fall into her frame!
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 22:49): But I don't know if I can just keep trying to fuck her I mean.. Won't that put her off?
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:51) (1x <3): Kiss her, and pull away and say I don't know what you doing to me. Stop trying to have sex with me. (credits goes to nate)
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:51): *you are doing
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 22:53): Hahahaha!
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 22:53): That's funny
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 22:54): Yes it's push and pull. Works great when done correctly
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 22:54): What are other push pull tactics?
Xander (2013-10-21 22:57) (1x <3): @Hot Tongs You're trying to dominate her body AND her mind
Xander (2013-10-21 22:57) (1x <3): Bounce back and forth between being sexual and playful
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:00): Hey what the fuck is everyone doing for Halloween
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:03): Should I do stuff like ignore her/ be on my phone for a couple mins or something?
Xander (2013-10-21 23:03): That's not playful...
Xander (2013-10-21 23:03): You only do that sort of thing to punish her if she's being difficult
Xander (2013-10-21 23:03): Like throwing tons of shit tests your way
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:03): Oooh
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:04): Not if they're just like.. Not willing to advance?
Xander (2013-10-21 23:04): Correct
Xander (2013-10-21 23:04): What you're confronting is a comfort problem
Xander (2013-10-21 23:04): Playfulness builds comfort
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:05): Makes much more sense
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:05) (1x <3): I've punished girls for no reason then, must have been mad confusing
Xander (2013-10-21 23:05): Hahaha
Xander (2013-10-21 23:06): Okay, if she says something like, "We're moving too fast!" you should be responding playfully
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:07): Like how?
Xander (2013-10-21 23:07): It's kind of a shit test, but not really. She's letting you know that she doesn't want to merely be a slut
Xander (2013-10-21 23:07): Which is where the comfort-building comes in
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:07): Ah
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:08): Okay, it makes sense, I've done that before but never articulated what it was
Xander (2013-10-21 23:08): She's thinking "Does he value me for more than just my body?"
Xander (2013-10-21 23:09): And you being playful and engaging in witty banter/asking her about her life
Xander (2013-10-21 23:09): Is going to dispel such fears
Xander (2013-10-21 23:09) (1x <3): It's the fear of the pump-and-dump. She's the gatekeeper of sex, but you're the gatekeeper of commitment
Xander (2013-10-21 23:10): Her biology wants you to stick around post-coitus
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:18) (2x <3): Just had a really good date. I like this girl
Xander (2013-10-21 23:19) (3x <3): @Philly Phil I feel like you fall in love with every girl
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:19): It's true
Nate (2013-10-21 23:19): I cannot begin to describe this girl.
Nate (2013-10-21 23:19) (1x <3): The best words I can find is I've met the manic pixie dream girl
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:20): Umm what
Nate (2013-10-21 23:21): This girl was... I dunno.  So unbelievably sexual.  I'm trying to decide if anything she told me was true though.
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:21): Ah I see
Nate (2013-10-21 23:21): I don't even understand what just happened
Xander (2013-10-21 23:21): @Philly Phil Zooey Deschanel, basically.
Nate (2013-10-21 23:21): Yeah if she was blonde
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:21): Did you fuck her
Nate (2013-10-21 23:21): Yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:22): Oh haha
Nate (2013-10-21 23:22) (2x <3): For one thing the best blowjob I've ever had, far beyond anything I've ever experienced
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:22) (2x <3): She's a keeper
Xander (2013-10-21 23:22) (1x <3): Nothing beats a great blowie
Nate (2013-10-21 23:22): Honestly I don't know what this girls mind is like, I hope I can see her again.
Xander (2013-10-21 23:23): Better than pagina
Nate (2013-10-21 23:23): It was just that, she was... really different.
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:23): Looks like everyone is falling in love
Nate (2013-10-21 23:23): I'm too confused to fall in love
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:23): You sound like your in love
Xander (2013-10-21 23:23) (2x <3): @Hot Tongs Nah, you need a soul for that
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:24) (1x <3): Lol how is that possible you just busted a nut
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:24): Nothing clears the head better
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:24): 💘💖💔
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:24): Story of my life ^
Nate (2013-10-21 23:25) (1x <3): No conversation we had was remotely like any conversation I've had ever
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:26): Nate I think we need a fr = fuck report
Nate (2013-10-21 23:27): @marky I don't know where to begin
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:27): It always helps to start from the beginning
Nate (2013-10-21 23:27) (3x <3): I'm trying to decide if I just fucked a high priced hooker...
Nate (2013-10-21 23:27) (1x <3): without paying
Xander (2013-10-21 23:28) (2x <3): @Nate That's alright, start with the ending. I always fastforward to the ending anyway
Nate (2013-10-21 23:28): Well the ending ending is she left.  Wasn't my choice.  Not sure what to make of it.
Nate (2013-10-21 23:28): She talked about coming back, and said she liked me tho
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:29): Sounds like you got played or something lol
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:29): Lol
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:30): He was used
Nate (2013-10-21 23:30): Well she was certainly a whole lot more direct than any woman usually is
Hot Tongs (2013-10-21 23:30): Probably what girls think when they leave our apts
Nate (2013-10-21 23:31): I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of a player now yes
Nate (2013-10-21 23:31): I'm not sure what if anything she told me was the truth
Nate (2013-10-21 23:32): Although I think she's been hurt pretty bad before
Nate (2013-10-21 23:32) (1x <3): Sorry if I sound like a girl, I'm just kinda in shock.
Xander (2013-10-21 23:32) (2x <3): @Nate LOL Your rationalization hamster is spinning madly!
Nate (2013-10-21 23:33): My "this night didn't make sense to me" is going nuts
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:34): Anyway my date went awesome we didn't kiss the whole night for some reason and then at the end had a really bad awkward kiss
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:34): And I was like that kiss was bad
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:34): And then we made out
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:34) (1x <3): Good shit
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:35): She's really cool 5'10" blond very European
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:36): Well she's Dutch
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:36): I would see her again
Xander (2013-10-21 23:39) (1x <3): 10/10 Would See Again
Mark (2013-10-21 23:39) (1x <3): Girl Phil and I met from Solas on Friday just left my place
Mark (2013-10-21 23:40): Super cute tibetan/dutch mix
Mark (2013-10-21 23:40): Only 3rd week in NY... Mmm fresh meat
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:41): Oh yeah forgot about her
Xander (2013-10-21 23:41): Nice guys
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:42): You seeing Dana tomorrow
Xander (2013-10-21 23:42): Yes
Xander (2013-10-21 23:42): At least, I believe so
Xander (2013-10-21 23:43) (2x <3): She is the only girl I have ever met who texts less than me
Xander (2013-10-21 23:43): That is, who is still displaying interest
Xander (2013-10-21 23:45): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/47106c901cfa0131a0a732ce93e6bd9f
Nate (2013-10-21 23:45) (3x <3): I just whipped out a glass of vodka and some lucky charms
Xander (2013-10-21 23:46): I keep sending her picture messages, usually drunkenly
Xander (2013-10-21 23:46): Should probably stop doing that
Xander (2013-10-21 23:46): Or... keep doing it
Xander (2013-10-21 23:47): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/a1a096801cfa01315c48128450107c0b

Xander (2013-10-21 23:50): Uh oh, Marbles just said something about GOL being able to go sexual from the get-go because of his looks
Xander (2013-10-21 23:50): Here come the clowns!
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:50): Lol @xander these texts are not looking good
Xander (2013-10-21 23:51): Don't Mark.
Xander (2013-10-21 23:51): I see you typing
Xander (2013-10-21 23:51): @Philly Phil Think I blew it up?>
Xander (2013-10-21 23:51): You too, Phil. Stop typiong
Xander (2013-10-21 23:52): *typing.
Xander (2013-10-21 23:52): Okay, as long as it's trolling, that's acceptable
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:53): Lol
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:53): What
Xander (2013-10-21 23:53): @Philly Phil You're probably right. Think I screwed the pooch on this one.
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:53): Who knows
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:54): She's tricky
Xander (2013-10-21 23:54): I should probably just cancel my date for tomorrow
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:54): Hahah
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:56): Its fun trolling
Xander (2013-10-21 23:56): Yes it is
Xander (2013-10-21 23:56): It's also fun to cancel all your dates for the week
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:57): Thats no fun dude.
Marky Mark (2013-10-21 23:57): We should go to 'no fun' to celebrate
Xander (2013-10-21 23:57): You're just not masochistic enough
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:57): I think it's kinda fun to cancel
Xander (2013-10-21 23:58): It sucks because I actually like this girl
Philly Phil (2013-10-21 23:59): That'sssss theeee problemmmmm
Xander (2013-10-21 23:59): I know
Xander (2013-10-22 00:00): And I ruined it
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:00): Well maybe but you don't really know
Xander (2013-10-22 00:01): IT'S RUINED FOREVER
Xander (2013-10-22 00:01): HYEAAHHHHHHHHHHHh
Xander (2013-10-22 00:03): sakjfdkjdsakjf;skjfkjsfkjaskjfkjsfkjsfkjsakjf
Xander (2013-10-22 00:03): WHERE'S MY ALCOHOL
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:04): Meth is more cathartic
Xander (2013-10-22 00:04): I WANT CANDY
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:04) (2x <3): One word texts are amazing.. ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f3ca71701cfc0131424f6ab13422847f
Xander (2013-10-22 00:05): I'M OUT OF THE GAME, GUYS
Xander (2013-10-22 00:05): LIVING IS TOO HARD
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:05): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/273c81001cfd013193d65606ea3c4c9f
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:05): Bye xander
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:06): Let have party
Nate (2013-10-22 00:06): I'm a mess of wtf
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:06) (1x <3): With strippers
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 00:06): For xander
Xander (2013-10-22 00:06) (2x <3): AT LEAST I PASSED ON SOME OF MY TEXT KNOWLEDGE BEFORE DEPARTING THIS WORLD
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:07): Okay I'm off to dream land
Nate (2013-10-22 00:07): I'm gonna go cry
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:08): Herro
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:08): Oh hey jimmy
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:08): JIMMMYYYYYY
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:08): We missed you
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:08): Long time no chat, been busy w/ my parents in town sigh
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:08): Oh yea
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:09): I randomly ran into mark and Nate on Saturday by USQ
Nate (2013-10-22 00:09): I spent half the day with you yesterday, doesn't feel like you've been gone
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:09): Haha
Xander (2013-10-22 00:09) (1x <3): Oh yeah, I should probably meet Mark...
Nate (2013-10-22 00:09): @Jimmy I met the manic pixie dream girl tonight
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:10): O snap how'd it go?
Xander (2013-10-22 00:10): @Jimmy My text game has left me. God has forsaken me
Nate (2013-10-22 00:10): I haven't got a clue
Nate (2013-10-22 00:10): @jimmy never met a girl like this ever in my life.  I'm trying to decide if nothing, or everything she told me was true.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:10): Huh? What was so unique
Nate (2013-10-22 00:12): We never had a normal conversation.  She was more sexually forward than any women I've ever know.  She passively mentions some wierd experiences, like being around billionaires.
Nate (2013-10-22 00:12): Her mind was all over the place
Xander (2013-10-22 00:13): Roofies can do that
Nate (2013-10-22 00:13) (1x <3): And I lied, we didn't have sex.  We were naked in bed, and I had the best blowjob of my life, but we didn't....
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:13): Was she on something
Xander (2013-10-22 00:13): Meh, close enough
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:14) (1x <3): That's even better sometimes, u have to do no work
Nate (2013-10-22 00:14): I'm wondering if she decided she liked me.
Nate (2013-10-22 00:14): No she wasn't on anything, I just think she was rather unusual
Nate (2013-10-22 00:14): I think she had a rather colorful life
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:14): Assume that she likes u
Nate (2013-10-22 00:15): Well she said so
Nate (2013-10-22 00:15): She also seemed surprised I wasn't a dick
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:15): Haha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:15): Sounds like a great date then
Nate (2013-10-22 00:16): I think she came into this thinking about a one night stand, and decided she liked me
Nate (2013-10-22 00:16): It was a great date, but I've honestly never met someone like her.  Every conversation was a story, or a roleplay.
Nate (2013-10-22 00:17): The only thing I think I can be sure of is she's new to the city and from Chicago
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:18): Honestly I'm not sure if you'll see her again
Nate (2013-10-22 00:18): I think she's way more experienced than I am.  Jesus.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:18): It's just a guess
Nate (2013-10-22 00:18): @Phil neither am I
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:18): Way to be encouraging Philly phil
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:19): :-)
Nate (2013-10-22 00:19): Well she did talk about seeing me again, and couldn't find some hair pins and said she'd come back for them.  Who the fuck knows.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:19): Who knows she just seems crazy
Nate (2013-10-22 00:19): Yeah I'm pretty sure she was nuts
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:19): From how you describe her
Xander (2013-10-22 00:19) (3x <3): *female
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 00:20): Lmao
Xander (2013-10-22 00:20): Apparently I got myself into some hot water this weekend while I was drunk
Nate (2013-10-22 00:20) (1x <3): Just COMPLETELY not like any girl I've ever met in my life
Xander (2013-10-22 00:20): Told this girl who was a friend of a friend not too worry too much about her career, since she was going to marry a well-to-do guy in a few years
Nate (2013-10-22 00:21): lol
Xander (2013-10-22 00:21) (1x <3): The reason she was pissed off was because it was true
Xander (2013-10-22 00:23): Oh, and this girl was like, "What do you think you're doing?" when I had my arm around her friend's shoulders
Xander (2013-10-22 00:23): Me: "I think she would have mentioned it in the past 5 minutes if I was making her feel uncomfortable"
Xander (2013-10-22 00:24): Stupid feminist cockblocking attempts
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:27): :(
Xander (2013-10-22 00:27): Then I left the dumb college party and had sex with a mother of three
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 00:27): :)
Xander (2013-10-22 00:30): Anyway, I hope my date happens tomorrow
Xander (2013-10-22 00:30): If it doesn't, I might go into a narcissistic rage
Hot Tongs (2013-10-22 09:26): girl yesterday didn't really ask me anything about myself.. job.. age.. does that mean she's uninterested or nervous? I think nervous cus we were like kissing and holding hands, just thought it was wierd. any thoughts?
Nate (2013-10-22 09:28): @Tongs if you heard the surreal conversation I had last night you'd think yours was normal
Hot Tongs (2013-10-22 09:29): lol read all about it
Nate (2013-10-22 09:29) (3x <3): She texted me this morning, so I'm guessing it wasn't just a 1 night thing
Nate (2013-10-22 09:30): I have no idea what yours meant tho, hard to tell without seeing the girl
Nate (2013-10-22 09:30): and how she acted
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 10:01): @david was she touching u at any point, were you touching her at any point, if so it wasn't that she was nervous. It may have been that she was just interested in the moment.
Xander (2013-10-22 11:43): http://vivas.fi/nain-miehet-ja-naiset-erovat-toisistaan-katso-kuvat/
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 11:50): yo I've been reading the rational male
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 11:51): pretty ridic
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 11:53) (1x <3): In a good way?
Xander (2013-10-22 11:56): @Philly Phil I left my copy with my friend in Indiana ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/658431001d600131f0db02dc9e8bbe50
Xander (2013-10-22 11:56): Whoah, why did my phone and that picture again. Weird...
Xander (2013-10-22 11:56): *send
Mark (2013-10-22 11:57): Xander, lol that texting flow chart
Mark (2013-10-22 11:57) (3x <3): http://i.imgur.com/DkyKwvw.jpg
Mark (2013-10-22 11:57): seems like something you would write
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 11:59): lol yep
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 11:59): oh god sandeep
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:00) (2x <3): your existence depresses me
Nate (2013-10-22 12:00): Well I understand him, because I used to be like that
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:00) (2x <3): shit sandeep says "yesterday - was trying to just talk to a wall"
Nate (2013-10-22 12:00): well not that part
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:01): I can't respond without being an asshole so I'm going to ignore him
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 12:02): Philly Phil
"yo I've been reading the rational male
pretty ridic"

Can u explain watchu mean
Nate (2013-10-22 12:02): I was pretty blunt there
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 12:02): OP

Pls respond
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:02): lol I mean its pretty good a nice condensed version of how I'm starting to see gender roles
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:03): the font is really fucking tiny in my version 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:03): my one complaint 
Mark (2013-10-22 12:04) (1x <3): yeah i've been reading some of Rollo's stuff lately and it's pretty interesting
Mark (2013-10-22 12:04) (1x <3): if you're into bio evolution and are a nerd like me
Nate (2013-10-22 12:04): I think it's safe to say we're all nerds here...
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:05): fairly safe
Mark (2013-10-22 12:16): Phil did your book arrive or are you reading blog posts
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:17) (1x <3): I got the book
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:20) (1x <3): @nate that article you posted is pretty basic. definitely a good post for the other chat
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:21): I got bored of it
Nate (2013-10-22 12:21) (1x <3): That's why I posted it on the other chat
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:39): so this girl I've been seeing has slowed down her response rate to my texts 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:39): we've been having a conversation but she only sends one text per day
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:39): I'm trying to set something up with her for this week but I have to text less frequently than her 
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:44) (1x <3): Try calling phil
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:45): yeah that's a good idea ^ haven't tried that too much 
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:46) (1x <3): Thinking about calling this girl today ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/68563e801d670131d4340e9f62d38f66
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:46): I'm so. Confused how i gave her a hickey
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:46): oh man "sorry but there won't be a next time"
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:46): that fucking cold
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:46): Yeah...
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:47): I know. Maybe she is pissed about the hickey that I didn't give her maybe I did fuck if I know
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:48): hm
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:48): honestly I would cut her off
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:48): or just respond "okay" 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:48): after a day
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:49): Its been 2 or 3 days. Didnt reply.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:49): ah 
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:49): I know she like me. But she is crazy :)
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:50): *likes
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:51): Saying okay is agreeing. Calling is a good idea, and ignoring that text completely
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:52) (1x <3): Nothing to lose, I will burn it to the ground if need be :)
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:52): U have a date tonight phil
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 12:52): Or r u going out
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:54): no date 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 12:54): I'll probably wind up going out
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 13:01): Cool. Let go out and aim for instadates
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 13:02): What time do u have in mind
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 13:12): well i was gonna go out tonight
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 13:12) (1x <3): like later around 9-10
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 13:12): for 2 or 3 hours
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 13:12): see what sticks
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 13:20): I need to shower and work out. So i will call or text u when I get to east village.
Xander (2013-10-22 14:21): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b3aaa9801d740131f0db02dc9e8bbe50
Xander (2013-10-22 14:35): Help me think of a place, guys ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/9e29ca801d7601310fdc4631d2ce17f2
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:37): hm
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:37) (1x <3): take her to flat iron room 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:37): I like that place
Xander (2013-10-22 14:39) (1x <3): @Philly Phil By the way, the pictures I was sending are an example of next level texting
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 14:40): I think some of you were interested in taking the kickass academy workshop
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 14:40): Ben & Charlie are gonna be in town in Nov. for 3 wks
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 14:40): http://www.kickassacademy.com/us_workshops/
Xander (2013-10-22 14:41) (1x <3): We just got our pictures taken at work, and the photographer told me that I had a bad-ass stare
Xander (2013-10-22 14:43): @Philly Phil The Flatiron Room looks legit, but it's also kinda out of the way
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:46): what area are you looking for
Xander (2013-10-22 14:48): The thing is, I'm not sure what she's expecting out of me
Xander (2013-10-22 14:49): We had an awesome time at Solas for our previous date, so I don't really know where to take things from here
Xander (2013-10-22 14:50): Okay, I just told her to meet me at the Flatiron Room at 8:30. Whatever, I'll figure it out
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:50): what do you mean about not knowing where to take things
Xander (2013-10-22 14:50): The thing is, I'm surprised by how much I like this igrl
Xander (2013-10-22 14:50): *girl
Xander (2013-10-22 14:51): So I don't want to necessarily just pump-and-dump her
Xander (2013-10-22 14:51): Maybe pump-and-pump-and-pump
Xander (2013-10-22 14:52): This cold and fatigue are turning me beta. Whatever
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:53): lol I guess so
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:53): idk I would say try to extract yourself from this whole situation and whatever you might or might not be feeling about it
Xander (2013-10-22 14:53): There is some extreme attraction there. It would be difficult for me to mess it up at this point
Nate (2013-10-22 14:54) (1x <3): @Xander take it to bed of course
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:55): @Jimmyayo I just might do that workshop
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 14:55): I've never done one and maybe it will help iron out some of my current issues
Nate (2013-10-22 14:57): Ben and Charlie are awesome
Xander (2013-10-22 14:58): You mean, people who actually know what they're doing?
Nate (2013-10-22 14:59): yeah
Xander (2013-10-22 14:59): As opposed to the snake oil salesmen hocking their wares in the other chat
Xander (2013-10-22 14:59): *hawking their wares
Nate (2013-10-22 15:00) (1x <3): That reminds me, I need to send them an update email on my progress
Xander (2013-10-22 15:02): It looks like I have nothing booked after tomorrow
Nate (2013-10-22 15:02): I have something tomorrow, but she hasn't confirmed and is flakey as hell.
Nate (2013-10-22 15:03): Got a couple to try and schedule too
Xander (2013-10-22 15:03): I could schedule more people for this week, but I'm tired
Nate (2013-10-22 15:03): Yeah I'm getting tired
Xander (2013-10-22 15:03) (1x <3): It's a nice feeling to not feel desperate like the guys in the other chat
Nate (2013-10-22 15:04): I do hope Lidiane actually replies to my text about having dinner later in the week though.  She hasn't answered it.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:05): I have something thursday and I was supposed to meet with marbles12 on wednesday
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:05): but I would rather set up a date 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:06): I also have a date this weekend and I want to see willemijn 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:06): again
Nate (2013-10-22 15:07): I wanna see Edie (last night) again too.  Not sure yet whether she wants to
Nate (2013-10-22 15:09): I should have taken pics, she was an 8.5 I'd say at least.
Xander (2013-10-22 15:11): Oh, by the way, I'm seriously thinking about getting a camera
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:12): okay I signed up for this workshop
Xander (2013-10-22 15:12): Link? Doubt I can afford it, but whatevs
Xander (2013-10-22 15:12): nvm
Xander (2013-10-22 15:12): Link it further up
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:12): ya
Xander (2013-10-22 15:12): *is
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:14): this still feels very sketchy and corporate 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:14): but whatever
Nate (2013-10-22 15:15): Ben and Charlie's thing?  haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:16): yea
Nate (2013-10-22 15:16): Because they accept payment via a website? :)
Nate (2013-10-22 15:17): It's their business
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:17): it was more the emails I got 
Nate (2013-10-22 15:18): They are probably aping everyone elses emails.  There is a formula to writing them effectively.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:18): yea yea
Mark (2013-10-22 15:18): Nate, the one you attended was $150 for 2 days right?
Mark (2013-10-22 15:18): this one is $400 for 1 day
Nate (2013-10-22 15:19): No it was $150 for one day
Mark (2013-10-22 15:19): hm
Mark (2013-10-22 15:19): how many hours?
Nate (2013-10-22 15:19): They are flying here though and don't have a job or apartment now.  I'm not at all surprised it's more
Nate (2013-10-22 15:20): We met around 11 or 12, something like that, and stayed out until about 7pm
Mark (2013-10-22 15:20): Phil, you already paid?
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:21): yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:22): hm this is all about approaching
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:22): I mean I could use some help for day game
Nate (2013-10-22 15:22): Yeah, it's about approaching, and the conversation, hooking the girl, getting the date, etc
Nate (2013-10-22 15:23): You tell them your sticking points, and they work on that with you
Nate (2013-10-22 15:23): @Phil it would help you a lot to set up recording on your phone and get it working
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:25): yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:25): I'm not even sure what my sticking points are
Nate (2013-10-22 15:32): Well aside for AA, not sure.  I haven't really seen you in action enough recently.
Mark (2013-10-22 15:32): Nate, is the whole day spent outside or is there some time spent inside
Mark (2013-10-22 15:32): with a presentation/lecture etc
Nate (2013-10-22 15:33): No lectures no.  It's all spent outside.
Nate (2013-10-22 15:33): Unless they've changed it
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:34): yeah I mean I feel like AA isn't even a sticking point for me because I already know how to solve that
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:34): and it's really something you chose to deal with or not
Nate (2013-10-22 15:35): Well they are really good at psyching you up to go out
Mark (2013-10-22 15:35): i feel the same way Phil
Nate (2013-10-22 15:35): Their energy is infectious
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:35): sweet
Mark (2013-10-22 15:36): i think my problem was that i bought too much into some of the marketing these companies have
Mark (2013-10-22 15:36): and i thought that it would be easier than it is
Nate (2013-10-22 15:36): Ahh
Mark (2013-10-22 15:36): but after talking to Nate about it, i realize it's like any other skill
Mark (2013-10-22 15:36): and there's a bunch of steps inbetween
Nate (2013-10-22 15:36): Yeah it's not easy.  They classes can give you a jump start, but it still requires a ton of work
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:36): yeah I mean I still think I would manage just fine on my own
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:37): but I'll try this 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:37): just for kicks
Nate (2013-10-22 15:37): Taking their class did help me a lot with some of my finer issues
Nate (2013-10-22 15:37): At the very least I'd pay to become friends with those two, they are awesome
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:37): lol 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:37): well that's cool 
Mark (2013-10-22 15:37): maybe if they lived here in NY
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:38): although I tend to not get along with super alpha guys because we but heads
Mark (2013-10-22 15:38): they seem to have been betas before getting into this stuff
Mark (2013-10-22 15:38): like most others
Mark (2013-10-22 15:39): anyways, i'm not sure i'm at the point in my development where i can truly benefit from something like this
Nate (2013-10-22 15:39): @Mark I'm certain you are
Mark (2013-10-22 15:39): i would've jumped at the opportunity if it were still $150 though
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:39): yea
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:40): I'm an impulse buyer
Mark (2013-10-22 15:40): lol
Mark (2013-10-22 15:40) (2x <3): my credit card bill for last month was twice what it usually was
Mark (2013-10-22 15:40) (3x <3): and i joined this chat precisely a month ago
Mark (2013-10-22 15:40) (3x <3): no regrets though
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:40) (1x <3): fun fun
Nate (2013-10-22 15:41) (3x <3): @Mark yeah where's the jewelry you promised me!
Mark (2013-10-22 15:41) (1x <3): i've got your ring pops right over here Nate
Nate (2013-10-22 15:56): @Phil got tired of the same dumb questions asked over and over :)
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:57): yes
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 15:57): fuck that chat annoys me sometimes
Nate (2013-10-22 15:58): Yeah it is pathetic.  They are always looking for excuses not to do anything
Xander (2013-10-22 16:08): Marky Mark just pointed out something significant to me, which is that I need to learn to be beta, especially in customer service
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:09): why would you be doing customer service
Xander (2013-10-22 16:10): If I start running workshops
Xander (2013-10-22 16:10): I'm not going to try teaching anything that I'm not confident in
Nate (2013-10-22 16:10): To run workshops you need to have the patience to work with hopeless idiots
Xander (2013-10-22 16:10): @Nate Exactly...
Xander (2013-10-22 16:10): I think I can manage it one-on-one
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:10): yeah I don't think I could do that
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:11) (1x <3): whatever they would pay
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:11): it wouldn't be worth it
Xander (2013-10-22 16:11): I'm in need of some supplemental income at the moment
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:11): yea 
Nate (2013-10-22 16:11) (2x <3): I remember there were people on my workshops who'd never been on a date, and wanted to take the workshop to get 'the one' as fast as possible
Xander (2013-10-22 16:11): And it would force me to think about my game from a different perspective, which would be good
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:12): yeah
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:12): I mean teaching can be a powerful tool to learn something yourself even better
Nate (2013-10-22 16:13) (1x <3): Being able to explain something, you have to actually know it.
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:13): yes exactly
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:13): well i went to school for teaching 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:14) (1x <3): so maybe I should do some fucking workshops
Mark (2013-10-22 16:14): i would pay for fucking workshops
Xander (2013-10-22 16:14): It's both awe-inspiring and nauseating that we're in an era where a few well-placed texts can mean the difference between forever-alone or poosy slayer.
Nate (2013-10-22 16:14): I could do day game workshops, but I'd have to be a lot less mean to people who don't approach
Mark (2013-10-22 16:14): texting is only one part of the process Xander, albeit an important part
Xander (2013-10-22 16:15): @Mark That's true
Xander (2013-10-22 16:15): I'm not only going to do text game workshops
Nate (2013-10-22 16:15): @Xander I'd love to have you explain why you send things, and not just that you sent them :)
Xander (2013-10-22 16:15): Or rather, texting would merely be a window into the proper red pill mindset
Xander (2013-10-22 16:15): I would love to go into the underlying theory
Xander (2013-10-22 16:16) (1x <3): @Mark Speaking of bio nerd stuff, you should read a book called The Myth of Monogamy
Mark (2013-10-22 16:16): i think good game lends to good texting... my texting improved after my game improved
Nate (2013-10-22 16:16): @Xander I'll buy you dinner if you do
Mark (2013-10-22 16:16) (1x <3): texting is game stripped of nonverbals, it's content only
Xander (2013-10-22 16:16): Whatever betaness may have lingered in my mind disappeared after reading that book
Nate (2013-10-22 16:17): My texting suffers in that I try to say things I would say in person, and the context gets lost and it sound dickish
Nate (2013-10-22 16:17): Ironically I can get away with that in these chats just fine though
Nate (2013-10-22 16:18): I'll check out that book
Xander (2013-10-22 16:18): That's because males don't take everything you say as a personal attack, unless they're super beta
Xander (2013-10-22 16:18) (1x <3): Beta = mind like a female
Xander (2013-10-22 16:19): Evolved strategy to demonstrate to females that you'e "different" than those mean alphas, because you really "get" them
Mark (2013-10-22 16:19): i think the goal should be to become a Sigma rather than an Alpha
Xander (2013-10-22 16:20): You can empathize with girls because your thought patterns work similarly
Xander (2013-10-22 16:20): @Mark Definitely beats gamma male
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:20) (1x <3): I understand women in the way that a father understands his daughter 
Xander (2013-10-22 16:21) (1x <3): @Nate I would be honored to take you up on that offer
Xander (2013-10-22 16:22): Walter White is a classic example of a Gamma male
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:22): pre drug lord
Xander (2013-10-22 16:22): Nah, post drug lord too
Xander (2013-10-22 16:22): He was never an alpha
Mark (2013-10-22 16:23): what i meant with Sigma is someone who can put on Alpha or Beta masks depending on what the situation calls for
Mark (2013-10-22 16:23): it's Machiavellian in taht way
Xander (2013-10-22 16:23): @Mark Yes
Mark (2013-10-22 16:23): and politicians are experts at it
Mark (2013-10-22 16:24): i see the same thing with higher ups at my company too
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:26): http://www.2shared.com/complete/BZHsnKhd/The_Monogamy_Myth_-_A_Personal.html
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:27): weird the fucking file is trying to access amazon 
Xander (2013-10-22 16:29): That isn't it...
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:29): oops hahah
Xander (2013-10-22 16:30): http://www.amazon.com/The-Myth-Monogamy-Fidelity-Infidelity/dp/0805071369/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382473807&sr=8-1&keywords=the+myth+of+monogamy
Nate (2013-10-22 16:30) (1x <3): Your complimentary virus is now available
Xander (2013-10-22 16:30): I doubt it could make a dent on my linux machine
Nate (2013-10-22 16:31) (1x <3): Wine ftw
Mark (2013-10-22 16:31) (2x <3): i'm an imposter, linux frightens me
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:31): here is chap 1 http://ls2content.tlcdelivers.com/content.html?&customerid=735&requesttype=text-chapter&button=false&isbn=0716740044&upc=
Xander (2013-10-22 16:32): Linux is fucking amazing
Xander (2013-10-22 16:32): Using Windows makes me sick
Xander (2013-10-22 16:32): I can use Apple computers, but only because they have the Bash command line
Xander (2013-10-22 16:33): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)
Nate (2013-10-22 16:36): Windows guy here
Nate (2013-10-22 16:37): Without windows how would I play terraria?
Xander (2013-10-22 16:39) (1x <3): Nerd alert... I'm thinking about buying Pokemon X and Y
Xander (2013-10-22 16:40): I'm going to justify it by how successful with women I've been these past two months
Mark (2013-10-22 16:41): Pokemon is fucking the shit
Mark (2013-10-22 16:41): at least the old ones
Xander (2013-10-22 16:41): I want to keep my video games separate from my computing, that way I can easily separate the two
Mark (2013-10-22 16:41): the newer Pokemon look like they all have downs
Xander (2013-10-22 16:41): I can throw my gameboy in a drawer if things start getting out of hand, rather than being tempted every time I'm working on lines of code
Xander (2013-10-22 16:42): Apparently this series is supposed to be the best Pokemon generation ever made
Mark (2013-10-22 16:42): can't be better than the first one
Mark (2013-10-22 16:42): but idk haven't played in like 10 years
Xander (2013-10-22 16:43): They said that it was like playing the first one again
Xander (2013-10-22 16:43): Except that a bunch of the original pokes are rendered in beautiful 3D
Xander (2013-10-22 16:43): Makes me want to jizz myself just thinking about it
Mark (2013-10-22 16:43): you're making me really want to play it now lol
Mark (2013-10-22 16:44): except my attention span is shit and i probably won't finish it
Nate (2013-10-22 16:44): I've never gotten more than half way through a pokemon game
Mark (2013-10-22 16:45) (1x <3): actually my attention span is fine, it's just that 12 yr old me wasn't preoccupied with vagina all day and could actually play the game
Xander (2013-10-22 16:45): Yeah, I think I need some mindless bullshit to balance out all of this vagina questing
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:45): 12 yr old me was
Nate (2013-10-22 16:46): 12....yr old
Mark (2013-10-22 16:47): i'm happy all my game consoles got stolen when I lived in Brooklyn a few years ago
Nate (2013-10-22 16:47): My ego loves the other chat today
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:47): lol 
Nate (2013-10-22 16:47): Everyone is saying how awesome I am :)
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:47) (1x <3): I blow up a little
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 16:48): *blew 
Mark (2013-10-22 16:48) (1x <3): i can't bring myself to post in there... it's like preaching to the choir
Mark (2013-10-22 16:49): and a compliment from Sandeep & Co barely gets me hard anymore
Mark (2013-10-22 16:49): i need harder stuff
Nate (2013-10-22 16:49): It's like the machine from Demolition Man.  It may not be worth much, but it's still nice
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 16:52): I try to only dole out compliments when I really mean it
Xander (2013-10-22 16:55) (2x <3): A compliment from me will send you to the ER for maintaining an erection for longer than six hours.
Xander (2013-10-22 16:57): I logged back out of GothamLife, but I'm going to have to log in at some point to offer my services.
Nate (2013-10-22 17:01): I had an erection for more than 6 hours once.  I don't recommend it
Xander (2013-10-22 17:02): @Nate Did your vision also turn purple?
Nate (2013-10-22 17:04): My balls did
Nate (2013-10-22 17:04): No I wasn't on drugs then
Xander (2013-10-22 17:09): I'm so dehydrated that the turd I just laid looked petrified
Nate (2013-10-22 17:10) (1x <3): They have this amazing stuff called water, it works wonders
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:10): like from a toilet?
Xander (2013-10-22 17:11): I have been drinking water non-stop since I left Indiana. That's how much I drank this past weekend.
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:17): OMG did I tell u guys how much I love water
Nate (2013-10-22 17:18) (1x <3): <-- takes a sip
Nate (2013-10-22 17:18): Oh ibuprofin I love you
Xander (2013-10-22 17:20): I do need to drink less
Xander (2013-10-22 17:20): Less alcohol, that is
Nate (2013-10-22 17:20): Look at this crap:
Nate (2013-10-22 17:20): whoops I can't it wont let me paste it..
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:20) (3x <3): Phil:(talking about marcelle)
she's super feminist
so everything is an argument over gender roles and morality

Nicole:
Oh really
Ok that is annoying
Just fuck her really hard and then say: that's how gender roles are!!
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:21): she's pretty awesome this girl
Xander (2013-10-22 17:21): I'ma SHOW you how gender roles are

Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:31): its called Spy Camera OS
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:31): my friend sent it to me so no idea where to find it
Mark (2013-10-22 17:32) (1x <3): that's an app, i think he's talking about a standalone camera
Mark (2013-10-22 17:32) (1x <3): like james bond shit
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:32): hahah

Xander (2013-10-22 17:32): I'm not talking about an Android app
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:32): :)
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:33): one of those Pens cameras

Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:33): that's what I use
Xander (2013-10-22 17:33): I'm talking about putting a high-quality camera between my books
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:34): ah gotcha
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 17:34): just get a regular video camera
Xander (2013-10-22 17:34): Where I can record myself fornicating
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:35): anyone been to SL on a tuesday night
Xander (2013-10-22 17:36): In meatpacking?
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:36): yup
Xander (2013-10-22 17:39): @heartiste: Your Daily Game: Approaching in coffee shops is tough, b/c it's so obvious. Try making a face at the girl first. Chicks love silliness.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:40): @Marky Mark not on a Tues, only Wed
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:41): It was packed pretty nicely around 1am
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:42): When?
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:42): @jimmy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:44): Maybe a month ago?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:45): If you go w/ a hot chick, it's a great way to meet some promoters - going early-ish on a weekday
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:46): a promoter just me a message to come party at SL tonight
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:47): so these promoters get paid only if they bring 10 ppl in 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:48): The pay structure differs for each club/hospitality company, but yeah it's something like that
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:50): Jimmy u should become a promoter. 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:53): I've thought about it
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:54): Do it.
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:54): If i had more time I would love to do it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:55): My buddy had to stop promoting @ Marquee, he was asking if I'd be interested in taking over his Sat. spot
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:56): So all u had to do is show us
Marky Mark (2013-10-22 17:56): Up
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:57): No, I'd need to meet a mgr @ the club, have a cpl trial nights to see if I can bring enough talent
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:58): But the life of a promoter kinda sucks tbh
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 17:58) (2x <3): I mean it's work.  And working every saturday night sounds like it would get old real fast
Xander (2013-10-22 18:02): Ugh, I have to work this Saturday, because I went home yesterday
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 18:05): My promoter was pretty unhappy w/ me last friday for bringing 6 girls to the club.  2 were ugly and short, had never met them before
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 18:06): He said to her right in her face "you can't sit with us"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 18:06) (2x <3): Fucking hate ugly girls 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 18:06): Haha
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:06): jeeze man that's cold
Jimmyayo (2013-10-22 18:07): Why would they go clubbing???
Xander (2013-10-22 18:09): Kim Kardashian is short
Xander (2013-10-22 18:09): It was the ugliness that was the problem
Xander (2013-10-22 18:12) (1x <3): https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard

Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:15): lol I should send this to a chick
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:15): "My dates tonight: mortification and solitude."
Xander (2013-10-22 18:15): That should probably be my new Tinder tagline
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:16): loll 
Xander (2013-10-22 18:23): I feel like I should flake on my date tonight because I'm kinda sick
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:32): kay I made this my new tag line 
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:32): "If I am continually running errands in life, my soul is dissipated in multiplicity. So... just chillin'"
Philly Phil (2013-10-22 18:32): good shit
Nate (2013-10-22 18:49): I wanna flake a little, but I'll change my mind later when I'm there

Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:20): see
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:20): then you bend her head over her bed and fuck her face
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:21): oh you have to tie the neck too
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:21): not necessarily  
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:21): this one is a little over the top
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:21): you can just do wrists to ankles
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:21): rope is probably better than cuffs huh?
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:21): yes
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:22): I've done it with a few belts
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:22): belts yes

Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:24): I actually purposefully don't talk occasionally to create those
Mark (2013-10-23 10:25): yeah same here, although it depends on the stage of interaction
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:31): Ben and charlie emailed me asking questions about my life
Mark (2013-10-23 10:33): i watched their online class yesterday: https://www.udemy.com/meet-women-by-being-awesome
Mark (2013-10-23 10:33): was not very impressed... a bit too basic for me
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:35): i'm not creative enough.. what else can you do to a girl that likes to be tied up?
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:35): spank 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:35): tease
Nate (2013-10-23 10:35): @phil they want to get an idea of how they can help you
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:35): leave her there and go eat dinner
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:35) (1x <3): you can just fuck her anyway you please 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:36): if she complains gag her
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:36): but she wants me to describe it it to her..
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:36): so describe that
Mark (2013-10-23 10:36) (2x <3): go read 50 shades dude
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:36) (1x <3): I want to tie you up and go eat a sandwhich
Hot Tongs (2013-10-23 10:36): lol
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:36): and then tease you for hours
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:36): idk 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:37) (2x <3): don't read 50 shades you'll want to jump out of a building
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:37): lol 
Mark (2013-10-23 10:37) (3x <3): i want to tie you up and then forget about you until you're a decomposing corpse reeking of rotting flesh
Mark (2013-10-23 10:38): bitches love imagery
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:39): "like my soul"
Xandong (2013-10-23 10:48): NSFW:

Marky Mark (2013-10-23 10:56) (1x <3): Im thinking about it
Marky Mark (2013-10-23 10:57): $400 is a bit much.. I will hit them up and ask if they can make me a big discount 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:57): It is.. but I figure I'm probably never going to take a course again 
Mark (2013-10-23 10:57): just paid
Nate (2013-10-23 10:58): They are flying here and spending a whole day with you marky, seems like a pretty fair price
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:58): and I know these guys are cool and good at what they do
Marky Mark (2013-10-23 10:58): is it one on one
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:58): its a max of 6 people
Nate (2013-10-23 10:58): Well it's Ben and Charlie together
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:58): so no it's not one on one
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:58): I'm sure everyone will have their own time
Mark (2013-10-23 10:59): egg. cited.
Nate (2013-10-23 10:59): Everyone does.  I didn't feel under-attentioned
Nate (2013-10-23 10:59) (2x <3): I should just get on salary with them at this rate...
Phillatio (2013-10-23 10:59): @Mark what's your last name
Mark (2013-10-23 11:01) (1x <3): i was thinking about all the weed i could buy for $400
Marky Mark (2013-10-23 11:01): hahah
Nate (2013-10-23 11:11) (1x <3): I love trolling
Mark (2013-10-23 11:11) (1x <3): lmao "so this girl on tinder is responding to me and she's real"
Mark (2013-10-23 11:11): wtf
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:12): its really depressing
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:12): sometimes
Nate (2013-10-23 11:12): yeah
Mark (2013-10-23 11:12) (1x <3): you mean all the time
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:12): ugh that girl is hideous 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:13): that he posted
Mark (2013-10-23 11:14) (2x <3): fuck, why did i click on that
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:19): Who said that
Nate (2013-10-23 11:19): contro of course
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:19): Jesus...
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:20): I'm not logged into that group. I can't take it
Nate (2013-10-23 11:20): contro makes Sandeep look well adjusted sometimes
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:21): What do you guys think of winnnnnnnnnn? Seems like he has calibration issues on the opposite end of the spectrum from most of the other guys
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:21) (1x <3): "WE GON FUCK OR WHAT"
Nate (2013-10-23 11:21): yeah he swings toward asshole
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:21) (2x <3):  he kind of pisses me off. and then he earns my respect because of that
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:21): so I wind up neutral 
Mark (2013-10-23 11:22): he's got too much test, the others have too little
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:22) (1x <3): That's the thing, I would rather watch winnnnnnnnnnn blow up sets than other hardcase noobs do nothing and not open
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:22): oh def
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:23): My test levels are so high that it's coming out of my pores, making every other man around me more masculine as well
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:25): I'm kind of amazed that winnnnnn hasn't already cave man-ed some bitch
Marky Mark (2013-10-23 11:25): how was ur date yesterday 
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:26): It went well. Fellas, unless you're me, don't even attempt to navigate the shitstorm of shit tests that I did yesterday
Mark (2013-10-23 11:28) (1x <3): shit tests are easy if you have a strong frame
Mark (2013-10-23 11:29): if you can't think of a witty reply, just ignoring it earns you points
Mark (2013-10-23 11:29): it's win/win
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:29): She was like, "How many dates have you been on since you've been here?"
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:29): I was like, "Oh, at least 20"
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:30) (1x <3): Her jaw dropped
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:30): and your penis was inserted
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:30): I wish. She's playing hard to get
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:30): ah 
Mark (2013-10-23 11:30): did you bed her yet
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:30): still like her?
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:31): Yeah, I still like her
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:31) (1x <3): This is the girl who I showed up to our date with my neck covered in hickeys
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:32): We had met at 13th Step 2 weeks before our first date, but I had kind of written her off
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:32): probably made her like you more
Mark (2013-10-23 11:32): depends on the girl
Mark (2013-10-23 11:32): if she's a player herself, she will respect it
Mark (2013-10-23 11:32): otherwise player vibes will hurt you
Mark (2013-10-23 11:32): had to learn that the hard way
Phillatio (2013-10-23 11:33): I still haven't learned that
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:33): I think that it would have been a detriment, but we clicked well when we first met, so she was willing to overlook it
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:33): Since she's not a player kind of gal
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:34) (1x <3): Heh, we ended up talking about alpha/beta male last night, and she was like, "Which one are you?"
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:34): I just smiled at her and said nothing
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:35): "Well, with 20 dates already, I think I know which one you are"
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:39): I don't really know what I'm doing any more. I have lost my bearings
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:39): I'm supposed to go on a date with a Tinder girl tonight, but I'm not even that excited about it
Mark (2013-10-23 11:39): progress is learning, forgetting, and re-learning
Mark (2013-10-23 11:40): not to get all zen or anything
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:59): Anyone else excited for this? http://youtu.be/6VdGI5-z_hg
Xandong (2013-10-23 11:59): http://youtu.be/6VdGI5-z_hg
Nate (2013-10-23 12:00): Some parts were funny, the rv scene wasn't
Xandong (2013-10-23 12:00) (1x <3): Maybe we should take a Clojures field trip to watch it
Nate (2013-10-23 12:00): Pick a buddy!
Mark (2013-10-23 12:02) (3x <3): 1:05 in the trailer was shot in my office lobby
Xandong (2013-10-23 12:07): Ugh, I have a fucking Lana del Rey song stuck in my head. Somebody just shoot me
Nate (2013-10-23 12:08): Here replace it with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6zr6kCPj8

Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 13:00): Haha yes
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 13:00): I like to plan things
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:01): @Nate Join me in eschewing girls for the comforts of video gaming and beating off into a sock
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 13:01) (1x <3): We should get some cheap chinatown food and head to a bar somewhere in LES

Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:13): Lana Del Rey
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:13): yep 
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:13): Her music makes me feel funny inside
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:14): I know I should hate it, but I can't help listening to it...
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:14): lol 
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:14): Probably because it provides such clear insight into female psychology
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:14): I've been listening to this one song all week
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:15) (1x <3): the high road
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:15) (1x <3): broken bells
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:15): I really dig it 
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:15): That Lana del Rey song Ride is basically about the tragedy of female hypergamy run amok
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:17): which one
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:17): summertime sadness
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:17): Nah, Ride
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:18): But Summertime Sadness is the one that I currently have stuck in my head...
Marky Mark (2013-10-23 13:18): OMG 

summertime sadness was the shit back a few months ago
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:18): I've been listening to the album Baths - Cerulean all week. Good shit
Xandong (2013-10-23 13:20): @Phillatio Good shit, I remember this song
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:49) (1x <3): nice I just got my 100 dollars back 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 13:49): so I owe you 20 bucks @Mark

Marky Mark (2013-10-23 14:08): Anyone going to Calvin Harris this weekend  http://www.flavorus.com/event/CALVIN-HARRIS-R3HAB-More/189576

Phillatio (2013-10-23 15:05) (1x <3): @Marky Mark yes obviously
Nate (2013-10-23 15:57): Ugh, flakey girl confirmed, although she has plans later in the night too.  I don't really feel like going
Nate (2013-10-23 15:58): If I go it's because I've literally been trying for this one for like 3 months, and I feel like I should go just so it was worth whatever effort was put into it.
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:02): I know what that's like @nate
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:02) (1x <3): I just had a half hour conversation with my mom about red pill theory 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:02): weird conversation 
Mark (2013-10-23 16:02): wtf
Mark (2013-10-23 16:02) (1x <3): stop trying to game your mom
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:03): lol I know man its the freudian in me
Mark (2013-10-23 16:03): so how did she take it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:04) (1x <3): up the ass, how else?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:04): sorry 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:04): hahaha
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:05): she seemed pretty on board with it.. of course I have a way of explaining things that make people instantly agree with me
Nate (2013-10-23 16:05): I talked to my mom about picking up girls too :)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:05) (1x <3): <nodding> go on
Nate (2013-10-23 16:05): I didn't mention red pill tho
Nate (2013-10-23 16:05) (1x <3): Told her I teased a lot and stated what I wanted
Mark (2013-10-23 16:06): i read that as "i teased her a lot"
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:06) (1x <3): oh me and my ma talk about anything so I was telling her all the chicks I banged recently 
Mark (2013-10-23 16:07): i'm sure you didn't use that particular phrasing
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:07): I mostly like shocking her 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:07): no I said I've been having a lot of sex lately with gorgeous blonds
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:07): she said that was pretty unsurprising 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:08): so I had to up my game to shock her today
Mark (2013-10-23 16:08) (2x <3): i'm gonna play pop psychologist and say that we're all a bunch of momma's boys
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:08): I was a daddys boy 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:08) (2x <3): until he died
Mark (2013-10-23 16:09) (2x <3): so... how bout them knicks?
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:09): lol 
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:09): I'm a daddy's boy
Nate (2013-10-23 16:10): I find it amusing that I'm complaining about having to go on dates
Mark (2013-10-23 16:10): but this one is a serial flaker
Nate (2013-10-23 16:10): Also I don't even remember what she looks like
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:10): I don't really want to go on my date tonight, but she seems nice
Mark (2013-10-23 16:11): i'm going to astoria for my date, yall shouldn't be complain
Mark (2013-10-23 16:11): in
Mark (2013-10-23 16:11): bringing my pepper spray
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:11): I have no date...
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:11): how sad
Nate (2013-10-23 16:11) (1x <3): Yes, were kicking you out of the channel Phil
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:12): fuckkkk
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:12): okay hold on I'll set one up
Nate (2013-10-23 16:12): lol
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:12): @Phillatio You can move my shit while I'm on my date
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:13): sounds like an awesome time
Mark (2013-10-23 16:15): did you find a place in the city Xandong
Mark (2013-10-23 16:15): Rich told me he's moving in soon
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:17): I almost want to text portia
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:17): I guess I kind of don't care
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:18): if that works out or not 
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:23) (1x <3): I'm crashing Marky Mark's living room in Newport until we find a place in the city
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:23) (1x <3): He has a huge apartment at the moment which he pays way too much for
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:24): @Philly Phil How have you squandered all of your most promising prospects?
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:26): @Xandong by being an ass
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:27): I also cut some girls off and haven't been gaming as much
Xandong (2013-10-23 16:28): I feel like I have left so many girls who are in love with me in my wake
Mark (2013-10-23 16:37) (2x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d9c7d1001e5001318cd9227a76e2a733

Mark (2013-10-23 16:40) (1x <3): lol @ body type: fit
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:40): she's not fit
Mark (2013-10-23 16:41): she's a wildebeest in human clothing
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:41): gross
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:41): @xandong wtf 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:42) (1x <3): you say the craziest shit to her
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:42) (1x <3): "fit"
Nate (2013-10-23 16:42) (1x <3): Fat in Tights
Mark (2013-10-23 16:42) (2x <3): sausage casing anyone?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:43): She sounds like a horrible loser
Jimmyayo (2013-10-23 16:44): Like she just sucks at life
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:44): probably can suck a golf ball through a garden hose
Nate (2013-10-23 16:44): Whenever someone calls themselves 'straightforward', it's usually code for I'll get tired of hearing their voice after 30 minutes
Nate (2013-10-23 16:44): or less
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:45): this girl sounds so boring
Nate (2013-10-23 16:45): She mentions IN her profile that's she's afraid of heights
Mark (2013-10-23 16:46): well, yeah, gravity would not be kind to her
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:46): and she's short as fuck
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:46) (2x <3): I'm not sure why she's so afraid she's already so close to the ground
Nate (2013-10-23 16:48) (1x <3): I feel like that girl saw too many episodes of King of Queens and Everybody Loves Raymond and thought that's what real men want in a woman.
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:50) (1x <3): @Mark can we go do this one weekend http://i.imgur.com/jeJJGa4.jpg
Phillatio (2013-10-23 16:50): http://i.imgur.com/jeJJGa4.jpg
Mark (2013-10-23 16:51): we can totally hotbox that
Mark (2013-10-23 16:58) (1x <3): check this out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3DgnKdBz8Y
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:12): it would be good to have one of those in a zombie apocalypse 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:12): no energy needed and fast escapes
Nate (2013-10-23 17:13) (1x <3): I want one
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:27) (1x <3): http://i.imgur.com/TBrjnWE.png
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:27): that's hilarious 
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:30): http://youtu.be/MGRa5TX0MaQ
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:45): So who else has a date tonight
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:50): I'm trying to set shit up
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:51): I just texted portia
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:51): she texted me literally one second later
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:51): I'm not sure what to do here because she's flaked on me so many times
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:52): I'm listening to Lana del Rey right now. I'm getting inside bitch's minds
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:52): I'm going to mind rape my date tonight
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:53): fuck 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:53): she keeps texting me 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:53): okay its on
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:56): I should probably read back through our Tinder conversation to remember who the fuck she is before we meet
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:56): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-23 17:56) (1x <3): willemijn deleted her tinder right after she met me
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:58): She found God
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:58): http://abowman.com/google-modules/hamster/
Xandong (2013-10-23 17:58): Just found the best rationalization hamster widget
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:08): Looks like my date's at Solas again
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:09): Imagine that
Phillatio (2013-10-23 18:09) (2x <3): see you there
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:28): LOL
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:28): I hope this girl doesn't turn out to be an uggo
Phillatio (2013-10-23 18:29) (1x <3): I'm meeting marbles for a beer
Phillatio (2013-10-23 18:29): I'm slightly less than enthusiastic 
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:32): Dude, that sounds more worthwhile than most girls
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:32): http://www.aesopfables.com/cgi/aesop1.cgi?4&TheScorpionandtheFrog
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:38) (1x <3): Ugh, I just sneezed really hard and bit a chunk out of my tongue
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:39): Hopefully that won't affect any makeouts I may be engaging in
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:39) (1x <3): My mouth is kinda pooling with blood at the moment...
Phillatio (2013-10-23 18:41): just have it drip down your chin
Phillatio (2013-10-23 18:41): bitches love vampires
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:42): This Emily thing may be coming to a close
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:42): She keeps getting increasingly pissed when I blow her off
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:47): @Phillatio When are you gonna be at Solas
Xandong (2013-10-23 18:47): My date is at 9
Nate (2013-10-23 20:11): I realize I still have a ton of work to do.
Xandong (2013-10-23 20:13): @Nate You mean with not being a little bitch?
Nate (2013-10-23 20:18): yeah that too
Nate (2013-10-23 20:19) (1x <3): I'm not good with girls if they aren't quick to laugh and easy to tease.  Also need work breaking down conservative girls.
Nate (2013-10-23 20:22) (1x <3): Generally more work in midgame
Xandong (2013-10-23 21:08): My date is about to show up. Here goes nothing
Nate (2013-10-23 21:16) (1x <3): I feel like showing up just to fuck with you
Xandong (2013-10-23 23:54): Do it
Xandong (2013-10-23 23:57): I can only imagine what's going on in GayLife right now. Someone needs to give me a field report
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:01): So I made out with a 38y/o last night
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:02): She was so fucking hot for her age damn
Nate (2013-10-24 10:02): @phil where were you?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:04): Brother Jimmy's
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:04): Which I forgot but I like that place
Nate (2013-10-24 10:04): You made out with a girl at a bbq joint?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:04): I hooked up with so many girls on st pats there
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:04): It's a bar
Nate (2013-10-24 10:04): ahh
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:05): Yeah pretty good bar for pick up I think
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:05): Of course really far for me
Nate (2013-10-24 10:05): Where is it?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:06): 31st and lex
Nate (2013-10-24 10:06): Ooh, I should start going there
Nate (2013-10-24 10:07): How was marbles?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:09): He's a cool dude but fairly new
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:09): He has potential though
Nate (2013-10-24 10:10): Cool
Nate (2013-10-24 10:10): I'm fairly new too :)
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:11): Lol I mean sort of depends on the context. I'd say you weren't new
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:11): I wouldn't even say I was new
Nate (2013-10-24 10:11) (1x <3): I've felt new this week.  3 bad dates.  Need more work.  Good and humbling though.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:13): Ah yeah that was mostly the girl though
Nate (2013-10-24 10:14): True, 1 was conservative and I think a virgin, 1 was a total bitch, and 1 was somewhat cool, but I just couldn't escalate in the time I had.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:15): I mean I would never want a conservative girl
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:15): I wouldn't care to work on breaking them down either
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:15): Not worth it
Nate (2013-10-24 10:15): I dunno, it would be nice to be better at breaking them down, but yeah I need to get better at texting so I can screen these girls more
Nate (2013-10-24 10:15): or just talk longer
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:15): Yea
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:16): Bitches are a different story
Nate (2013-10-24 10:16): All of these were from short interactions so I didn't get a time to know them before I saw them
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:16): I feel like you can busy through that if you know what you're doing
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:16): Bust*
Nate (2013-10-24 10:16) (2x <3): Yeah the Ukrainian was just a bitch.  She said she was positive but spent half the date bitching about all the things she didn't like and wouldn't do. Nasty
Nate (2013-10-24 10:17): Well bitchy and slutty is one thing, this was bitchy and conservative.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:18): Hm yea idk
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:18): So it's two things to bust through
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:20): Ukrainian though oh man
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:21): Those are my favorites brown hair tall and blue eyes
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:21): Fuck me
Xandong (2013-10-24 10:39): Th gfs f2f h huh d Dr kkbbn
Phillatio (2013-10-24 10:44) (2x <3): Xander's still trashed from last night
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:19): Girl last night was alright, but she's not as good as Dana so I don't currrrrr
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:29): yeah Dana is your girl
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:38): http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1p44ef/do_you_see_a_guy_different_when_hes_reading_a/
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:38): damn I read in public all the time
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:38): I should do that more often and day game
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:42): Take a page out of Dimitri the Lover's book and have a copy of The Red Book by Carl Jung.
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:43): Girl's love that emotional, superstitious bullshit
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:43): Girl last night was pulling out her horoscope app...
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:44): freaky
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:44): okay I can see why you didn't like her as much
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:44): Well, she didn't really believe in it
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:44): She was actually fine
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:44) (1x <3): they all say that
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:45): But she couldn't have been more than a 6.5
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:45): ah 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:45): that could be a problem
Nate (2013-10-24 11:47) (1x <3): @Xander well you were still with her when you texted me at midnight, so it couldn't have been that bad
Nate (2013-10-24 11:47): I was already in a alcohol induced sleep btw :)
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:49): My standards are too high these days
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:49): I was enjoying those $5 margaritas at Solas
Nate (2013-10-24 11:49): Did you sleep with her?
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:51): Nah
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:51): These logistics are impossible
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:52): Me coming from Jersey City, her coming from Williamsburg
Nate (2013-10-24 11:52): take a taxi to wburg
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:53): yeah williamsburg isn't so bad
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:53): specially from solas
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:53): probably about 20 minutes
Phillatio (2013-10-24 11:53): to get there
Nate (2013-10-24 11:53): Just walk to union square and take the L train, it's a pretty quick trip too
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:54): I wasn't really feeling it
Xandong (2013-10-24 11:54): If I want to bang, I'll go for it
Nate (2013-10-24 11:59): Fair enough
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:00) (2x <3): I GO WITH MY PENIS
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:03): my penis always points north
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:03): seriously it gets annoying walking south cause it goes up my butt
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:05): lol
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:07): Damnit, my friend in Indiana keeps hitting me up for game advice
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:07): I got him laid when I was there, haha
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:08): oh damn
Nate (2013-10-24 12:08): Gonna bang my Haitan girl this weekend, my Brazilian told me she's busy.

Marky Mark (2013-10-24 12:31): Funny shit. Called her bluff
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 12:31): Love playing poker
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 12:32): We should have a poker night
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:34): Heh heh
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:34) (1x <3): We could also play gambling Magic
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:35) (1x <3): magic the gathering anyone
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:36): I'm the god of gaylife today
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:36): I should just keep posting pics of all the girls I've hooked up with
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:36) (1x <3): Want to know how drunk I got this past weekend in Indiana?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:37): yes
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:37): I drunk drove to Meijer (like Walmart of the midwest) with my friends and purchased $100 worth of Magic booster packs from the latest set
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:37): At 4:00 a.m.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:37): hahahah
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:37): oh man
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:38) (1x <3): I used to play that game back in the day
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:38) (1x <3): I got pretty drunk last night this older dude who was friends with the 38y/o I was hooking up with kept buying me drinks
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:38): he's a good friend 
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:43): Magic is the best. I sold all of my cards before I moved out here, but I'm probably gonna build a few decks again
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:44) (1x <3): Looks like that hat-wearing Colombian girl wants to hang out tonight. Oh, and that mom from Mexico City wants to hang out on Friday
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:45): My latinas are coming out of the woodwork!
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:46): Except that's not the right idiom, since that implies that it's a bad thing
Nate (2013-10-24 12:46) (1x <3): I used to play Magic too :)
Nate (2013-10-24 12:47): I got a call from that instadate girl a while ago who's number always goes to voicemail and never calls me back.  She invited me to see a movie tonight.
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:47): @Nate Eww, worst date idea ever
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:47) (2x <3): Maybe we can all get hammered and play Magic sometime
Nate (2013-10-24 12:47): Haha sure
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:48): There is this format that's really cool called Commander, where you have a deck built around a legendary creature
Nate (2013-10-24 12:48): @Xandong I dunno.  I wouldn't mind seeing a movie.  Don't particularly feel like doing anything today so this is fine.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:48): my friend is unbeatable at that game
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:49): yea I hate movie dates but I would do it just for kicks
Nate (2013-10-24 12:49): I don't care so much about the date, I'll see a movie.
Nate (2013-10-24 12:49): I was just gonna chill at home anyway.  
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:50): Shiiiiit
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:50): I just texted Dana "Saturday"
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:50): She replies "I have a party Saturday"
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:50): I give up!
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:51) (1x <3): Beta Xander has risen from the ashes to reclaim his throne
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:51) (1x <3): @Phillatio Several of the people I used to play with in Indiana/California have been on the Magic Pro Tour, looooool
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:53): I'm gonna text back "lame.com"
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:54): lol lame.com
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:54): love it
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:54): I stole that from the girl from last night. She used that in our Tinder convo
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:55): lol

Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:56): I would totally bang her now 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 12:57): I mean she also has better hair/no glasses/ better make up
Xandong (2013-10-24 12:58): Don't lie Phillatio, you love big beautiful women
Xandong (2013-10-24 13:01) (1x <3): I told the girl from last night that I only use Tinder and bigbeautifulwomanhunter.com
Xandong (2013-10-24 13:01): When she asked me if I use okcupid

Nate (2013-10-24 13:17) (1x <3): I'm getting pua apathy, it's contagious
Phillatio (2013-10-24 13:17): I feel like I was in a lull for a week or so
Phillatio (2013-10-24 13:18): but I'm coming out of it now
Nate (2013-10-24 13:18) (2x <3): I've had a date every single day this week, I don't really need more women now
Phillatio (2013-10-24 13:19): loll 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 13:20): I could use a few more
Phillatio (2013-10-24 13:20): or some more responsive ones
Nate (2013-10-24 13:21): well only one of the ones I went out with this week is going into rotation, and she's not particularly reliable
Nate (2013-10-24 13:22): we will go out again most likely, but I can't say when
Nate (2013-10-24 13:23): I have the haitan girl this weekend, and my cougar coming into town so we'll see each other some time next week.  I gotta take some days off to myself.

Marky Mark (2013-10-24 16:00) (1x <3): Thinking about feminism, girls love to label themselves feminism until they have to pay half the check. Haha
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 16:01): *feminine

Xandong (2013-10-24 16:56): I mean, it doesn't feel like my best text work, but whatever
Phillatio (2013-10-24 16:56): a lot of girls dig that
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 16:57): A lady was complaining about it here at work, maybe she loved it.
Mark (2013-10-24 16:57) (3x <3): remove the 'okay, so'
Xandong (2013-10-24 16:58) (1x <3): Exactly what I was doing when you wrote that!
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 16:59): Xander learned to say 'thank you' haha
Nate (2013-10-24 16:59): Hmm, don't care about gay sex as long as it turns on the girl I'm with
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 16:59): *learn
Xandong (2013-10-24 16:59) (1x <3): I was thinking of just shortening it to "we'll play dress up another night"
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:00): Ok Im sick of this SwiftKey keyboard it's predicting incorrectly
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:01): @Mark Thank you!

Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:02): U owe me more than that ;)
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:02): -_- what does that face mean again?
Nate (2013-10-24 17:02): Yeah where is his reach-around
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:02): I'm not Asian enough to interpret it

Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:07) (1x <3): its a squinty face cause she wants you to cum in her eyes
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:07): I think it's shame
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:08): Like closing the eyes in embarrassment?
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:10): Bleh, whatever
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:10): Doesn't fuckin' matter!
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:13): I can do no wrong, since I'm Jesus Christ
Nate (2013-10-24 17:14) (1x <3): pronounced Hesoos Khurist
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:16): According to urban dictionary.. An emoticon symbolizing a sigh, usually a sigh of disgust
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:16): :(
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:17): Haha
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:17): eh nobody really knows what the fuck they're saying
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:17): when they use emoticons
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:17): I'm bullerproof
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:17): *I'm bulletproof
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:18): Comments like that demonstrate that I'm not overly concerned with what she thinks
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:21): Dude text her back.. Say.. monday night - dress up party
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:21): What
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:21): is the rush
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:21): And no
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:22) (1x <3): Dude u r the text king.
Marky Mark (2013-10-24 17:22): U got this
Mark (2013-10-24 17:22) (2x <3): it means 'i'm speechless'
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:23) (1x <3): Exactly, which is why I'm not texting her every 5-10 minutes
Mark (2013-10-24 17:23): it's neither negative or positive though
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:24) (3x <3): I wonder if she will make that face after I dick slap her
Nate (2013-10-24 17:24): Yes
Nate (2013-10-24 17:26) (2x <3): if this girl tonight turns out to be crazy and kills me, mourn my loss
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:29) (2x <3): @Nate I will hold a candlelit vigil for you
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:30): I'm pretty sure my bitch is gonna flake on me
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:30): tonight
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:30): @Phillatio You can have one of mine
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:30): she didn't respond to my confirmation text
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:31): Want to know something funny?
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:31): http://www.woot.com/plus/k3-powerbags?utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_campaign=c944f4ee6b-Daily+Digest+-+20131024+-+Woot&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c5ca76da11-c944f4ee6b-294470725
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:31): I was considering buying one of those powerbags until I noticed that tagline at the bottom: "A woman-owned company that makes mobile and portable electronic accessories? Go get you yours, girlfriends."
Nate (2013-10-24 17:33): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hceeF37JsQ4
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:34): This should be good
Nate (2013-10-24 17:34): It is
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:35): Saw his gf Elaine's tits and was immediately hooked
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:36): she's not that hot
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:36): I mean she's hot 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:36): but not unbelievable 
Nate (2013-10-24 17:37): She's a bit of a bitch, but it's hilarious all the stuff he does to her and she's like 'that's disrespectful' and still sees him
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:37): Yeah, still. That guy has some game, since look at him
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:37): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:37): yep
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:37): He has T-Pain body type
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:37): she sounds like a retard
Nate (2013-10-24 17:40): Just shows how much you can get away with just by doing it
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:42): "There were stains on the bed and empty condom wrappers. I don't know what I was thinking"
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:42) (1x <3): Yeah fucking right
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:44): yeah I'm not in the game to meet chicks like that
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:44): that's for sure
Nate (2013-10-24 17:44): She has way too much attitude for me
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:46): Yeah, definitely a 9 looks-wise, but not any other way
Nate (2013-10-24 17:46): ya
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:46): Prime pump-n-dump candidate!
Nate (2013-10-24 17:46): Yeah, I'm amazed he kept her around
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:46): idk 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:46): I'm not too into her face
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:47): I'd say she was a 9 but just barely
Nate (2013-10-24 17:47) (1x <3): She did have a fantastic pair of tits and ass though
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:48): yeah 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:48): I messaged that british girl laura 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:49): wished her a happy b day
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:49): Good man. I was wondering if you were gonna do that
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:49): yeah why not
Nate (2013-10-24 17:49) (1x <3): A girl I number closed last weekend didn't text me back when I asked her out for today, so I sent her the fruit pic
Phillatio (2013-10-24 17:49): I figure if shit doesn't go well with nicole in nov I'll hope on a train to london
Xandong (2013-10-24 17:52) (1x <3): @Phillatio Me too!
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:03) (2x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/02034af01f260131085f2ee0c23aa6d9
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:03): Time to see Kate!
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:03): sort of an awkward name
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:03): WB.
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:03): you'd bang that nigar?
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:03): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:04): this is verging on the inappropriate 
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:05): I'd kidnap her and take her back to my estate!
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:05): then I'd teach her a lesson
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:08) (1x <3): With a little cat o' nine tails action, make it kinky. She can call me "massa"
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:10): ...
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:10): yes all that
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:12): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/48b65f901f2701317a0476a0f64a2e97
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:12): this girl is getting increasingly weirder through text
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:13): w/e I don't give a fuck about her
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:13): "I'm not just looking for a hookup anymore"
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:13): Wait, have you even banged this girl yet, or is she talking about other dudes
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:14): Alright @Nate, see you at The Flatiron Room at 8 tonight. Let our Phil trolling session commence
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:14): I haven't banged her
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:14): no
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:15): seriously I would love to just fuck with this girl
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:15): I was so ready to move her to an inactive lead
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:16): Yeah, so she's basically saying that she's had her fun already but realized that she was giving away sex for free, so now she's gonna make you work for it
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:19): yea I guess
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:19): I still think I can probably fuck her
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:19): she said that because she's thought about fucking me
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:20): I love that Roosh tweet
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:20) (1x <3): "You will never find a woman who pays more for a used car than a new one. So why do they price their pussy like that?"
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:20): I think of it all the time
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:24): So since I rescheduled my date for tonight to tomorrow, what else is everyone doing
Mark (2013-10-24 18:26): date with vegan chick in an hour
Mark (2013-10-24 18:27) (2x <3): should i bring some cauliflower
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:27) (1x <3): @Mark She's gonna be too weak to fend off your advances
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:36): kay I'm bored at work
Phillatio (2013-10-24 18:36): going home
Nate (2013-10-24 18:41): This girl can't get the window of her car up, so she has to go get it fixed/up before she can meet me.  What am I getting myself into...
Xandong (2013-10-24 18:42): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/78de6d201f2b013114265a2379795021

Phillatio (2013-10-25 08:40): Jeeze can you use any more exclamation marks
Phillatio (2013-10-25 08:40): Also, damn that was easy
Phillatio (2013-10-25 08:45): Got a blowy last night. This girl sucks dick like a champ. Oh and she stayed over
Phillatio (2013-10-25 08:46) (2x <3): I filled her mouth up with cum and she got really surprised. She said no one has ever cummed that much with her
Phillatio (2013-10-25 08:47) (1x <3): We also talked about hitting on chicks and she told me how her friends always get approached with weird negs and opinion openers
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 08:59): how long ago is she from?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 09:01): how long ago is she from?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 09:01): how long ago is she from?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 09:01): how long ago is she from?

(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-25 09:43) (1x <3): MARKUS changed name to Maximus Decimus Meridius
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 09:48): Not to be racist or anything. But I think we need to invite one black guy :) we have 4 Asians 2 middle easterns and 2 white guys
Nate (2013-10-25 10:05): Find us a worthy black guy and we'll invite him
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:07) (1x <3): Haha none come to mind :(
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:07): I will have to go and explore the city for one. Who want to join me.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:07): *wants
Nate (2013-10-25 10:12) (3x <3): Police Officer: What are you doing lurking around here
Nate (2013-10-25 10:12) (3x <3): You: I'm looking for black guys
Nate (2013-10-25 10:15): I'm gonna start working out again today.  My back is so fucked up, it's not fair.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:16): Nate do you have a workout plan
Nate (2013-10-25 10:17): I'm starting out with basics.  I'm gonna do the P90x abs workout, pushups, pullups, squats.  The problem I have is there is damage to my back muscles and if I push too hard in the beginning I throw out my back.
Nate (2013-10-25 10:17): I can repair it, but it's hard.  
Nate (2013-10-25 10:19): I might go to a professional sports massage therapist again to help with my back.  I need to break up the scar tissue
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:19): Have you tried insanity
Nate (2013-10-25 10:19): A little bit
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:20): I think that should be better for ur back
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:20): it relays on the knees and feet the most
Nate (2013-10-25 10:21): True, although I do want to start working on my upper body too
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:31): Insanity is mostly upper body
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:31): if u need the videos I have them on Drive
Nate (2013-10-25 10:31): Ahh, and it's certainly good for weight loss.  It's pretty intense
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:31): I can share them
Nate (2013-10-25 10:31): I have them
Nate (2013-10-25 10:31): Thanks tho
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 10:32): Np

Phillatio (2013-10-25 10:58) (1x <3): he seems cool but very new
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:01): I have met him too, but in a week I think he has got a lot better
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 11:02): yeah he seems like a cool person.. just not fully calibrated.. the texts he posts are so funny and vulgar
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:05): yea

Mark (2013-10-25 11:14): why do we need a token black guy
Mark (2013-10-25 11:14) (2x <3): isn't that a bit racist
Nate (2013-10-25 11:15): Actually it's a lot racist...
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:15): Ltd has too many inner game issues at the moment
Nate (2013-10-25 11:18) (2x <3): We can force him to make his nickname Token
Nate (2013-10-25 11:20) (1x <3): Yeah Ltd has too many 'I can't' 
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:28): @Marky Mark and I went to 13th Step last night. I was on the way to banging Phil neighbor...
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:28): Then R. Schmitty showed up
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:29) (1x <3): @David Tongs Who cares about number of approaches. I'm more interested in the conversion rate
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:30): Excuse me, @Hot Thongs
Nate (2013-10-25 11:33) (1x <3): We also don't need another complainer in here, that role is already filled by me
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:33): Haha
Nate (2013-10-25 11:37): I think I may get some more numbers this weekend despite my apathy.  I feel like I could use a couple more girls in my rotation that aren't quite so unpredictable.
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:37) (2x <3): R. Schmitty is pretty good, but he's kinda like the used car salesman of Game
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:38): Rich is very good. A true Pua but understand he is like Ben and Gol
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:38): Same style.
Nate (2013-10-25 11:38): You mean really good and slightly sociopathic?
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:39): Yup
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:39): Yeah, see... I make girls fall in love with me
Nate (2013-10-25 11:39) (1x <3): @Xandong I haven't quite mastered that skill yet
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:39) (2x <3): They still text me 2, 3, 4 years later out of the blue
Mark (2013-10-25 11:40) (3x <3): that's because they're asking for child support
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 11:40): whos ben?
Nate (2013-10-25 11:40): Okay I'm reading a book today on game/inner game.  What do you think I should read?
Nate (2013-10-25 11:40): Ecstatic
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:41): Moby Dick
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 11:42): whats the diference between true pua and what we're  doing here?
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:42): This Spoke Zarathustra
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:42): *Thus Spoke Zarathustra
Nate (2013-10-25 11:43): @Hot Thongs the level of success
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:44): @Hot Thongs I think that what Marky Mark means is that R. Schmitty has his seduction skills on lockdown, but he doesn't necessarily have an alpha/red pill personality behind it
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:44): I should have used the word RSD
Nate (2013-10-25 11:44): I don't consider myself a true pua.  I can fill my schedule with women, but I don't own them like a true pua does...yet
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:47): Rich is giving a fr on gaylife
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:49): oh great
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:49) (1x <3): yeah I don't really want to be a pua
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:49): I don't really give a fuck
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 11:50): U can't fire me, I quit
Nate (2013-10-25 11:53): @phil I want the dominance I see a true pua has over women.  Don't really care about the title.
Nate (2013-10-25 11:54) (1x <3): I haven't been successful at this long enough to internalize a lot of it
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:57): honestly I feel like most guys take it too far
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:57): at a certain point
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:57) (1x <3): it just becomes too impersonal and automatic
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:57): like you're not even human anymore
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:58): I don't get what would motivate you at that point
Nate (2013-10-25 11:58): Maybe, but right now I'm still at the point where I'm chasing them
Xandong (2013-10-25 11:59) (1x <3): @Nate I like being chased
Phillatio (2013-10-25 11:59) (1x <3): too bad you're not black 
Nate (2013-10-25 12:00): @Xandong I know, me too.  
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:03): I have bitties calling me up, asking to hang out
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:03): I like that
Nate (2013-10-25 12:04) (1x <3): yeah I don't.  I always have to call them.  Hence me needing plenty of work.  Can't really complain though.  Right before I joined this chat I was having very little success at all, so it's just a matter of time and work.

Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:11): new tinder match
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:11): I can't tell if she's fat
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:11): Heh
Nate (2013-10-25 12:12): Not fat
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:12): Take a chance and roll the dice
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:12): all her pictures are chest up
Nate (2013-10-25 12:13): Dude, she has elbow pads with spikes on them...
Nate (2013-10-25 12:13): err shoulder
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:13): oh yea 
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:13): totally didn't notice that
Nate (2013-10-25 12:15): She's totally into being tied up and thrown around, go for it
Nate (2013-10-25 12:16): That first girl looks just like the chick from Entourage
Nate (2013-10-25 12:16): pic

Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:30): lol oops I guess
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:31): she's only upset cause its true
Mark (2013-10-25 12:35): you should tell her that
Nate (2013-10-25 12:38) (1x <3): @Xander please don't send spammy business offers to my personal email.  I have another email address for that.
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:39): she just sent me the same text and changed "tell a girl" to "complain to a woman"
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:39): wierd
Mark (2013-10-25 12:40): she has self esteem issues
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:40): yep
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:40): I don't think I'm going to even respond
Mark (2013-10-25 12:40): i'm a woman, not a girl damnit
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 12:41): haha that is wierd
Mark (2013-10-25 12:41) (1x <3): probably asian, have a feeling
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:42): yep she's asian
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:50): @Nate Too late
Nate (2013-10-25 12:51): Yeah I know
Nate (2013-10-25 12:51): Hence me saying that
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:51): ;-)
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:52): I realized it was a poor decision, but I still felt compelled to check your address
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:52): Something must be wrong with me
Nate (2013-10-25 12:53): @Xander Yeah something is wrong with you, a twisted wreck of smoldering ruin
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:55): Someone in the Game, I lost my soul
Nate (2013-10-25 12:56): You just dropped your soul on the ground.  It's a little dirty, but you can clean it off with a nice cloth.
Nate (2013-10-25 12:59): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ac55d2e01fc401310cbf6a2043d645f6
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:59): *Somewhere
Xandong (2013-10-25 12:59): Uh oh...
Phillatio (2013-10-25 12:59): uh oh is right
Nate (2013-10-25 12:59): Naah
Nate (2013-10-25 13:00): I made her dinner last time, but besides that we've only slept together and done nothing else.
Mark (2013-10-25 13:03): you should say something like 'great, i'll bring my mcdonalds gift card'
Mark (2013-10-25 13:03): 'should be enough on there for 2 double cheeseburgers'
Nate (2013-10-25 13:03): yeah I was thinking of "All you're getting is a slap on the ass and you'll like it"
Nate (2013-10-25 13:03): That works too
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:04): Haha
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:04): http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/24/what-men-like-in-men-an-argument-from-1902/
Mark (2013-10-25 13:05): tl;dr?
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:07): "How women hate him! They will always, in their heart of hearts, pardon a man who is impetuously overbold, even though they ever after shut him from their presence; but a Sissy with his flabby, feeble, mawkish imitation of an ardor which he never felt, affects them with a sort of moral nausea"
Nate (2013-10-25 13:07): lol
Mark (2013-10-25 13:07): that's an elaborate way of saying 'don't be a bitch'
Nate (2013-10-25 13:07): @Mark she replied 'Why not kfc?'
Mark (2013-10-25 13:08): haha nice
Nate (2013-10-25 13:10) (1x <3): how about "Aren't we getting fancy.  You have to earn kfc" ?
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:11): I like that
Mark (2013-10-25 13:11): yeah something like 'let's not push our luck. KFC is a 5th date kind of place'
Nate (2013-10-25 13:11): @Mark I don't want to imply we're dating
Mark (2013-10-25 13:12): oh you're not dating her?
Nate (2013-10-25 13:12): She recently called us friends, I like that.
Nate (2013-10-25 13:12): Mainly we're fucking a lot
Mark (2013-10-25 13:13): so basically fwb
Nate (2013-10-25 13:13): Yeah
Nate (2013-10-25 13:13): I mean last time I made her a romantic candlelight dinner, but I don't want to put dating in her head.
Mark (2013-10-25 13:13): can't tell if serious
Nate (2013-10-25 13:13): me?
Mark (2013-10-25 13:13): yeah
Nate (2013-10-25 13:13): serious
Nate (2013-10-25 13:14): I like it as fwb
Nate (2013-10-25 13:14): She's still getting over her previous boyfriend dying, and I don't want a serious relationship with her anyway.
Mark (2013-10-25 13:15): oh it's that one
Mark (2013-10-25 13:15): i remember now
Mark (2013-10-25 13:16): well in that case, your original suggestion was good, might want to shorten it to 'you'll have to earn that one'
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:18) (1x <3): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/field-report-the-dushka-and-the-cougar/#comment-490563
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:18): This is long, long comment
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:18): But everyone in here should read through it when they get a chance
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:19): Basically, it's about high-energy vs. low-energy game
Mark (2013-10-25 13:21): damn you weren't joking about it being long
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:22) (1x <3): @Mark That's what she said
Mark (2013-10-25 13:22): Xandong with the alley-oop
Nate (2013-10-25 13:24): She replied "We'll see"
Nate (2013-10-25 13:25): I was hoping she'd reply "How?"
Mark (2013-10-25 13:25): that would be too needy on her part
Mark (2013-10-25 13:26) (1x <3): i think now's a good time to end the convo
Nate (2013-10-25 13:26): That was what I was planning to do
Nate (2013-10-25 13:26): I'm not doing any of the things she asked for Sunday.  
Mark (2013-10-25 13:27): yeah fuck that
Nate (2013-10-25 13:27): She get a beer and my cock
Mark (2013-10-25 13:28) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d1e6ac101fc80131bccd36f13163ffc8
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:28): Oh, French girl just FB'ed me!
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:29): @Mark That's what I'm talkin' about!
Mark (2013-10-25 13:29): haha
Nate (2013-10-25 13:29): Yeah mark, you 'get it'
Mark (2013-10-25 13:30): i like that CH comment so far Xandong
Mark (2013-10-25 13:30): lots of nuggets on CH if you look for them
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:40): I feel like I drift between pro-active + laconic and pro-active + verbose depending on how I'm feeling
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:41): But I can get stuck in passive + laconic easily when I'm too tired/lazy
Mark (2013-10-25 13:41): yeah my thoughts exactly
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:41): Never pro-active + verbose, though
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:42): Because I ain't a little bitch
Nate (2013-10-25 13:42) (1x <3): Big bitch?
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:42): Pretty much
Nate (2013-10-25 13:42): Niiice
Nate (2013-10-25 13:42) (1x <3): Started Insanity per Mark
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:43): Let's do Crossfit and you can injure yourself even more
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:47) (1x <3): @Marky Mark Damnit, I was annoyed by your lack of approaching last night
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 13:50): Yeah sry not feeling great
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 13:50): too much shit going on in my head

Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:50): this girl might be a little crazy
Nate (2013-10-25 13:51): Remember when I said you weren't qualifying enough.  This is the girl literally telling you that.
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:51): lol
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:51): qualifying enough 
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:51): how do I do that
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:51): I would wait longer, let her sweat a little more
Nate (2013-10-25 13:52): The short answer is telling her reasons why you like her that aren't related to her looks.
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:52): oh yea totally
Hot Thongs (2013-10-25 13:52): or tell her you like small asses and chests
Mark (2013-10-25 13:52) (3x <3): send her this: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkv0mL95F-I/TttwTL7iniI/AAAAAAAAACU/2tp3QcFtBUA/s1600/umadbro.png
Nate (2013-10-25 13:52): You can do it by asking questions that elicit the qualities you like in a woman.
Nate (2013-10-25 13:53): Then validating it if she gives an answer you like
Xandong (2013-10-25 13:53): She's acting kinda churlish
Nate (2013-10-25 13:53): She's acting insecure
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:53): she is kinda childish
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:54): its pretty unattractive
Mark (2013-10-25 13:54) (1x <3): troll her some more, may as well go out with a bang
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:55): that'd be fine if I actually did bang her
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:56): I still would like to fuck the crap out of this girl
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:57): even if she is a stick
Mark (2013-10-25 13:57): i don't know if this is salvageable, but if you still want to try, i'd go with GOL's standard recovery line: 'sorry, i don't know how to talk to girls i like'
Mark (2013-10-25 13:57): something i stole from him
Nate (2013-10-25 13:57): @Phil read the magic bullets section on qualification also for the future.
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:57): @Nate can you link me that
Nate (2013-10-25 13:58): Yeah when I finish my workout I'll link you to that, and an audio talk you'll also like
Phillatio (2013-10-25 13:58): thanks man
Mark (2013-10-25 13:58): i can email to you Phil, have it here on my pc
Mark (2013-10-25 13:59): or whoever else wants it
Nate (2013-10-25 13:59): I also wanna send him one of the Love Systems audio interviews on it, really good
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 13:59): ***send it to me too
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-25 13:59): aalqas@gmail.com

TiMex (2013-10-25 14:02): Haha lurking
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:02): Or ears were ringing, whatever
TiMex (2013-10-25 14:03): That's why I feel funny inside
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:04): I read Magic Bullets back in the day. I'm sure I would have a completely different take on it now
Nate (2013-10-25 14:06): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kmmhb2ichgwfkeq/NUNL6d1vbd
Nate (2013-10-25 14:06): hmm, that didn't work
Phillatio (2013-10-25 14:06): I see an mp3 in there
TiMex (2013-10-25 14:07): I see nada. Then again I'm on phone app
Nate (2013-10-25 14:07): yeah
Nate (2013-10-25 14:07): There should be a bunch of mp3s
Nate (2013-10-25 14:14): zipping it up and uploading, will take another 10 mins to upload
Mark (2013-10-25 14:15): do you have more of this Nate?
Mark (2013-10-25 14:15): i like

Nate (2013-10-25 14:29): 1 more interval to go
Mark (2013-10-25 14:30): i don't see why you don't just get one of these: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXHUdvvHTkw
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:33): You know, all of those girls in the shake weight video wouldn't have "problem arms" if they didn't have extra fat
Mark (2013-10-25 14:35): 'why isn't this thing working? ohhh, it's because i'm just plain fat!'
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:35) (1x <3): I seriously hate fat people
Mark (2013-10-25 14:36) (2x <3): yeah fuck em, especially the girls. not literally of course
Mark (2013-10-25 14:36): they're directly decreasing the amount of fuckable vagina out there in the marketplace
Mark (2013-10-25 14:36): just because they can't put down the fork

Jimmyayo (2013-10-25 14:50) (3x <3): One of the managing directors is this 60yr old grandma, she's chilling in our office and is dancing to Ke$ha

Nate (2013-10-25 14:53): What happened to him?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-25 14:53): He was trying out the "secret society" mentality from that one infamous RSD post
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:55): Huh?
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:55): I vaguely recall that
Nate (2013-10-25 14:55) (1x <3): His society was so secret noone knew about it?
Mark (2013-10-25 14:55): secret society = alpha basically

Xandong (2013-10-25 14:56): Right, I've read it before
Xandong (2013-10-25 14:57): It's not that women are more likely to cheat, it's just that most men (since most men are beta or omega) can't
Jimmyayo (2013-10-25 14:57) (1x <3): So I'm gonna invite Dre$ here, hope yall don't mind

Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:02): Dude I had a weird ass night.. Still like.. Stunned
Nate (2013-10-26 04:02): What happened?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:03) (1x <3): Well.. A couple of players on the ny giants came to the bar and stole my date lol
Nate (2013-10-26 04:03): really?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:03): It's actually pretty funny
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:03): Yeah I mean.. It was a first date so I wasn't emotionally invested anyways
Nate (2013-10-26 04:04): Why did you let them talk to her?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:04): But like.. Damn that's never happened to me before lol
Nate (2013-10-26 04:04): Wow that sucks
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:04): She wanted to see who the big dudes were so we talked to them
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:05): It's okay.. I was on the fence if I wanted to sleep with her anyways
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:06): Made that decision easy lol
Nate (2013-10-26 04:06): Haha yeah
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:06): Hm I wouldn't know what to do on weekend evening dates now
Nate (2013-10-26 04:07): Where was this?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:07): I don't even know the name.. Kind of not that great of a bar in meatpacking.. I think right next to apple store
Nate (2013-10-26 04:08): Did she ask you if she could leave with them?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:09): Well.. Like she was all over one guy, and I was talking to other people at the bar.. The two players actually left first
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:09): And then she was like "oh he's my ex bf"
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:10): And was like trying to be nice to me and stuff.. Which I didn't really care cus.. Not emotionally invested an I was in a fun state talking to other ppl, dancing with ppl
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:11): But around like 3 the bar gets to be all dudes, and she wanted to like dance with a bunch of guys and stuff but by that time it wasn't entertaining for me anymore because it was like 85% men
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:12): So i just told her I was going to leave. I mean I wasn't upset, it just wasn't entertaining anymore
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:12): You fell asleep didn't you
Nate (2013-10-26 04:12): No I went to the bathroom :)
Nate (2013-10-26 04:13): Why didn't you just dance with her?  Sounds like you were ignoring her.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:14): In the end?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:15): I was ok with dancing with her, but she like started dancing with other guys too
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:15): And there weren't any more sets to open
Nate (2013-10-26 04:16): Yeah, I've never had a date like that.  When I'm on a date I don't open sets, and it's us together the whole time.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:16): Do you ever go to like a bar/club scene on a date?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:17): I feel like that setting has more opportunity
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:17): For that sort of thing
Nate (2013-10-26 04:17): Yeah, multiple times.  We talked to each other, made out a bunch, danced, sat with each other, made out more.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:17): Really?
Nate (2013-10-26 04:17): Yeah
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:18): Doesn't it get boring just talking to one person like that?
Nate (2013-10-26 04:18): No, otherwise I wouldn't be with them
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:18): Whenever I see other couples in those high energy bar environment s they most of the time look bored
Nate (2013-10-26 04:18): Guess they were never me :)
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:19): Lol
Nate (2013-10-26 04:19): When I'm in that kind of environment, I dance with the girl like there's noone else in the world.
Nate (2013-10-26 04:19): Hot sweaty action, us close together.
Nate (2013-10-26 04:20): It's perfect to escalate like crazy fairly quickly
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:20): What if you've slept with them already
Nate (2013-10-26 04:20): Unless I come with a group and we're all together, if I take a girl on a date, she's the center of my focus.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:22): Hm
Nate (2013-10-26 04:22) (1x <3): Otherwise it's not a date imho, it's two friends going to a bar.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:22): Ooh yes..
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:24): I guess it depends the girls take too
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:26): Anyways so this girl was kind of a hoe.. 930 met at bar.. 11 bounced to my apt.. And while deciding what to do, she surprised me to say " can I stay the night? Ill make it worth it"
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:26): Cus she had a 9am meeting like 2 blocks from my apt
Nate (2013-10-26 04:27): Well was it fun?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:27): It was okay
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:28): A learning experience
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:28): Albeit probably a damaging one lol
Nate (2013-10-26 04:28): haha
Nate (2013-10-26 04:28): Well I have no problem with a girl who's free with her sexuality
Nate (2013-10-26 04:28): Sounds more like you didn't like her than anything.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:31): Mm would have been okay to see if sex would have happened, but not too disappointed it didn't
Nate (2013-10-26 04:31): If you had danced with her a bit, and said "let's go" and left with her, it probably could have.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 04:32): It's okay.. I had reservations about fucking her because I wanted to like.. Sort of commit to one for now.. Out of respect
Nate (2013-10-26 04:33): Whatever floats your boat.  I have no problem with dating multiple women, and so far none has asked me to get serious
Nate (2013-10-26 04:33): It's only disrespectful if you're hiding it
Nate (2013-10-26 04:33): If you've found a girl you like and want to get serious tho, that's fine
Nate (2013-10-26 10:35): http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/society-and-culture/why-women-lose-the-dating-game-20120421-1xdn0.html
Nate (2013-10-26 10:36): Haha, that's me in a nutshell.  Now I have all the choice and no desire to stick to one
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:20): Glad to see some red pill shit here
Nate (2013-10-26 12:21): <-- Trying to thing of a good response bait text to ping to old numbers...
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:21): Man, I hate opinion openers. I was just thinking about that last night
Nate (2013-10-26 12:22): Naah, not opinion openers
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:24): Yeah, I know I'm going on a tangent
Nate (2013-10-26 12:24): tangent away
Nate (2013-10-26 12:24): yeah I don't like opinion openers, unless they are utterly ridiculous
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:25) (1x <3): @Hot Thongs I would personally never take a girl to a club for a date, because that's usually going to force me to have a higher energy level than I feel like engaging in
Nate (2013-10-26 12:26) (1x <3): I dragged my ass to meatpacking last night because a girl I #closed randomly drunk dialed me.  Only to have her phone off when I get there :)
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:26) (1x <3): @Hot Thongs Also, you don't want her getting distracted by other "prospects",
Nate (2013-10-26 12:26): A little while I sent "That wasn't very nice.  Someone was a bad girl"
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:27): Which is way more likely to happen at a club
Nate (2013-10-26 12:27): Some of my best dates were at clubs.
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:28): That doesn't disprove what I'm saying
Nate (2013-10-26 12:28): true
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:28): I'm speaking in generalizations
Nate (2013-10-26 12:28): Here is my ping text for the day "I am working on my plot for world domination, and I may need your help"
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 12:29) (1x <3): @nate you may have more success with "hey stranger"
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:29): The thing is, if Hot Thongs is having trouble with some basic shit like sustaining interesting conversation, all of the distractions in a club aren't going to do him any favors
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:29): That is, unless he goes fully sexual
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:29): With his Kino
Nate (2013-10-26 12:29): If you take a girl to a club you really have to dominate her time
Nate (2013-10-26 12:29): Sexual + dancing
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:30): Exactly, and I don't think that's where his head is at right now
Nate (2013-10-26 12:30): Yeah
Nate (2013-10-26 12:30): Whenever I have taken a girl to the club, the looks we were getting were 'Get a room"
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:30): Plus, if his banter/conversational skills are weak, he should be going to places where they are forced to talk in order to build those skills
Nate (2013-10-26 12:31): Also true
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 12:31): @xander at a club you have to have more energy than everyone in there, u have to be the center of energy.
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:31): Rather than relying on any Kino-based club game he may have
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:35): @xandong, where do you suggest? And also, I'm not sure if my banter skills are weak, but I find it really helpful if the girl is outgoing and witty
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:37): @Hot Thongs But you said that you get bored, right?
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:38): @Nate What kind of feeler text are you looking for again?
Nate (2013-10-26 12:39): Once a week or so I send a text to all my stale numbers.  Usually designed as response bait
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:41): @xandong like if i spend 7 hours with someone in a low energy setting where we have to talk and use our brains, unless theyre really fun to be with then like.. it gets boring.. is that usual?
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:42): SEVEN... HOURS...?
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:43): Did you propose to her at the end of it?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:43): lol okay even like 4 hours
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 12:44): Thats why it's good to start at a chill place - small bar etc
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:44): but im askinf for future reference cus i have a girl coming from out of town
Nate (2013-10-26 12:44) (1x <3): Don't spend 4 hrs at one venue, unless that venue is your apartment
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:44): and well be together all weekend
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:45): @Hot Thongs Oh damn
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:45): Nate is right. You should be bouncing her to different places
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 12:49): we did hop from venue to venue
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:50): @Nate Just send some random bullshit
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:50): "Just had a bowl of Cap'n Jack for breakfast"
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:52): @Hot Thongs I don't know what you're asking for exactly
Nate (2013-10-26 12:57): Well my ping text of the day is working decently so far
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:58): Tell them you had Cap'n Jack
Xandong (2013-10-26 12:58): DO EEEET
Nate (2013-10-26 13:03): Hmm, I already did the other
Nate (2013-10-26 13:03): I've got two variations on "What kind of help?" and I'm having writers block
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:05): @xandong i guess i want to know.. is it normal if you spend like 5 hours with someone that you'll run out of things to talk about.. or is it something i should work on.. but i guess it also highly depends on the girl
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:06): @Nate If they ask you what Cap'n Jack is, tell them that it's Cap'n Crunch with Jack Daniels poured on it
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:07): @xandong.. 5 hours in a low energy setting.. like bar, sit down restaruant, walk at park
Nate (2013-10-26 13:07): No I said "I am working on my plot for world domination, and I may need your help" and I'm not sure what to say when they ask what kind of help.  My brain is not working
Nate (2013-10-26 13:07): Any ideas?
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:07) (1x <3): @Hot Thongs Personally, I never run out of things to talk about, because I can always ramble about random shit. Maybe you should watch some Seinfeld like Roosh V suggests
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:09): It's about having fun, like a game. Not just interviewing each other
PropDres BigP (2013-10-26 13:09) (2x <3): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/why-ask-why-shun-the-stale-seven-questions/
PropDres BigP (2013-10-26 13:09): although to be fair, that article pertains to the front-end of the interaction
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:10): Business in the front, party in the back
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:12): @david after a max of 2hours take her to ur place.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:14): @max i did.. but we went out after
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:15): thanks guys, i think this helped.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:15): Why didn't u cut the date after u left ur place.
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:16): cus it was like 1130pm and she wanted to go out and then sleep over after
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:18) (1x <3): I have a feeling she was using you for ur place
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:18): @Hot Thongs Who dis chick
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:18): Also she was leading
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:18) (1x <3): Never let her lead
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:19): @xandong met her on the street, manager at h&m, just moved here 2 weeks ago
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:20): Where does she live atm
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:21): somewhere in brooklyn
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:21): like buschwick
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:23): @Hot Thongs Were you physically escalating?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:24): she was with me lol kept kinoing me, changed at my apt in the middle of the room.. we made out, she straddled me..
Nate (2013-10-26 13:26) (2x <3): That's the point where you are supposed to pick her up by the ass, carry her to your bed/couch and drop down on top of her.  Make out and slowly start slipping clothes off (unless they are already off even better)
Nate (2013-10-26 13:26): Get her horny as fuck and it's on
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:26): lol yeah i probably could have fucked her then.. but i didn't really want to
Nate (2013-10-26 13:27) (1x <3): Are you gay?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:27): she had lots of tats, teeth werent that clean, so accumstomed to throwing herself at men, i was worried about getting stds!
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:27): Then y did u let her stay over
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:28): and i thought its probably not worth it if i was to try to be committed at least for now with that other girl, to do it with this hoe
Nate (2013-10-26 13:28) (1x <3): @XanJesus Any suggestions on what I should say in response to my ping text?
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:28): she ended up not staying
Nate (2013-10-26 13:28): Good
Nate (2013-10-26 13:28) (3x <3): Don't become the sexless innkeeper
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:28): lawl
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:30): Wait...
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:30) (1x <3): Are you even asking advice about the aforementioned girl? Why do you even care if you weren't that interested?
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:31) (2x <3): @Nate "You're going to be my zeppelin pilot"
Nate (2013-10-26 13:31): I love your creativity
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:31): i guess because i have a lady friend coming from out of town.. and now i dont want to take her to bars/clubs at night!
Hot Thongs (2013-10-26 13:31): pure gold
Nate (2013-10-26 13:33): If they ask more, I'm gonna say "How else are we going to move the death ray"
Nate (2013-10-26 13:34): I gues
Nate (2013-10-26 13:34): @Hot Thongs during the week you can take her to bars/clubs.  They won't be full.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:35): What is everyone doing today
Nate (2013-10-26 13:35): Laundry, finding a costume, pinging girls
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:35): Anyway want to go to LAVO
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:35): http://lavo.electrostub.com/show.cfm?id=108381
Nate (2013-10-26 13:35) (2x <3): I sent about 100 ping messages
Nate (2013-10-26 13:37): @Max possibly
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:37): Lavo is known for hotness everywhere
Nate (2013-10-26 13:37): Aside for the prostitutes in the lobby, PHD had some super hot girls yesterday
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:37): @Nate Holy shit!
Nate (2013-10-26 13:38): @Xandong yeah :)
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:38): Super girl all over the place in meatpacking - phd 1oak etc
Nate (2013-10-26 13:38) (2x <3): one of the ones who replied so far is a russian model
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-26 13:39): *Super hot
Nate (2013-10-26 13:39): ahh
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:40): Oh right, I DID see Sandeep at Solas last night, lol
Nate (2013-10-26 13:41): How was your night?
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:42) (2x <3): Pretty good. Phil and I met up with Maximus Decimus Meridius and A E
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:42): At Niagara in East Village
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:42): A E was a supreme disappointment. Motherfucker wouldn't approach all night
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:44) (1x <3): Ended up at 13th Step, where Phil made out with a hot Brazilian chick who slipped through his grasp, and I found a cute, witty Asian chick in the back room who I made out with/number closed
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:45): She rebuffed me on my first kiss attempt, and I pretended not to even notice. Then when she had to leave later and asked for my number, I told her "Under one condition... You give me a kiss."
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:45): Her: "You drive a hard bargain"
Nate (2013-10-26 13:45): lol I've never heard of that working
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:46) (3x <3): Hahaha. I'm in god mode
Nate (2013-10-26 13:46) (1x <3): Some day I will have my conversation game as good as you Jesus
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:47) (1x <3): I ran into her again a few minutes later, because she still hadn't made it out the door, so we made out a bunch more
Nate (2013-10-26 13:47): nice
Nate (2013-10-26 13:49): No response so far for your zepplin pilot line.  Maybe I should have been more vague.  Time will tell.
Nate (2013-10-26 13:49): Course I took a while to reply, so they may be doing the same
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:50) (2x <3): I dramatically paused and held up my finger in front of her before delivering the "you give me a kiss" line
Nate (2013-10-26 13:50): Noted
Nate (2013-10-26 13:53): I have to find a good app to make pinging easier
Xandong (2013-10-26 13:54) (1x <3): @Nate Have an android? I could make one
Nate (2013-10-26 13:55): I do
Nate (2013-10-26 14:05) (2x <3): Actually I got a third girl to respond, but she ignored my ping and said she was out of town and would contact me when she was free
Nate (2013-10-26 14:07): The anal in me just noticed that when two chats are open, they aren't aligned horizontally...
Xandong (2013-10-26 15:49) (1x <3): Seriously... Phil and I saw dozens of attractive girls during our adventures last night.
Xandong (2013-10-26 15:49): A E is so full of shit
Nate (2013-10-26 15:54) (1x <3): Ltd shouldn't talk about being chodey
Xandong (2013-10-26 15:54): Yeah. That chat is hopeless
Phillatio (2013-10-26 15:57): Pretty much
Phillatio (2013-10-26 15:57) (1x <3): Just slept like a baby
Xandong (2013-10-26 16:04): A E being confronted with logic...
Xandong (2013-10-26 16:07): I feel as if I'm talking to a little kid

PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:12): i think i got burned out a bit with that
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:12): and soemtimes, it seems like gaming can burn u out in general
Nate (2013-10-28 11:12): I can respect new ppl when they are willing to try really hard, but not whiners
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:13): nate-dawg
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:13): have u ever got burned out from daygaming and such
Nate (2013-10-28 11:13): yeah last week, but my dance card was so full I didn't care
Nate (2013-10-28 11:13): I was feeling burnout in general thursday and friday
Nate (2013-10-28 11:14) (2x <3): Saturday too a bit, so I just had fun and drank a lot
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:14): I felt a bit burnt out last week
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:15): or two weeks ago rather
Nate (2013-10-28 11:15): @Dre tho you don't have to 'go out daygaming' once you're pretty good at it, you can just live life and run into girls like I did this morning on the way to work
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:15): yeah, seems like the risk/reward shifted into ur favor once u got competent
Nate (2013-10-28 11:15): yeah it took months of eating time before I got consistent.
Nate (2013-10-28 11:16): I did a couple hours of daygame yesterday and got 2-3 numbers, which is about average for a slow day
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:17): I'm most certainly not geared toward higher end clubs, myself
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:17): why not
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:18) (1x <3): Can't really stand that shit. Too loud
Nate (2013-10-28 11:18) (1x <3): Well you'll get a significantly better looking crowd and higher end clubs
Nate (2013-10-28 11:18) (1x <3): @Xander 13 step is freakin loud
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:18): That's true, haha
Nate (2013-10-28 11:18) (1x <3): I'd rather hit on 9's and 10's at a loud place and 6-8's
Nate (2013-10-28 11:18): then
Nate (2013-10-28 11:19) (1x <3): High end clubs are all 8-10's women
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:20) (1x <3): I haven't been to a club since I've been in the game
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:20): Everything on thursday is going to be loud
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:21): Club game is different than Bar game
Nate (2013-10-28 11:21): Very different
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:21) (1x <3): Meh
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:21): I can't stand clubs
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:22) (1x <3): I love to dance with hot chicks
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:22): It's just the whole atmosphere about it
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:22) (1x <3): I like talking 
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:22): Lifting up women as worthy of praise simply for being hot
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:22): Encouraging you to throw stacks at them
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:23): Phil u can talk if u can isolate 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:23): hmph
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:23): well I'm willing to give it a shot
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:23): maybe thursday
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:23) (2x <3): I just don't have any money right now
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:23) (1x <3): @Nate Every girl that I have had some kind of connection with is one who I shouldn't have met at a bar, let alone a club
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:24) (1x <3): To give props to your day game
Nate (2013-10-28 11:24) (2x <3): There is something to be said for the sheer fun of walking up to a girl, dancing with her, grinding with her, making out with her, and more, and not saying a single word to her.  
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:24): I already got out most of that shit in college
Nate (2013-10-28 11:24): I did that a ton in college
Nate (2013-10-28 11:25): well yeah I'm not expecting to meet the love of my life dancing with a bimbo in a club, but I don't mind just having fun sometimes
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:25): @Nate I knew it, you're insinuating that I don't ever have fun!
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:25): Motherfucker!
Nate (2013-10-28 11:25): @Xander don't be a whiney bitch girl
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:26): http://www.clubzone.com/events/686213/new-york/ravel-hotel-roofop/the-playboy-terrace
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:26) (2x <3): I can't help it. I've received so many dramatic texts lately
Nate (2013-10-28 11:26): @Xander you don't strike me as the type that likes to dance tho
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:26): @Nate I don't. I will occasionally, but I'm rarely in the mood
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:27): I mainly enjoy the no-pants dance
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:27): so does this chat prefer to meet girls in one location versus another
Nate (2013-10-28 11:27): I don't it frequently, but I love dancing
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:27) (1x <3): Tinder, Online, Daygame, 13th step lol
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:27): what's the flavor dujour
Nate (2013-10-28 11:27): Everyone here has different places they meet women
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:27): I dabble in Tinder
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:27): cue the guy who says: Nah bro, anytime is gametime
Nate (2013-10-28 11:27): I'm mostly day game
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:27) (3x <3): NAH BRO ANYTIME IS GAMETIME 
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:27) (2x <3): Damnit, I thought MidnightGrundleBoy was gone for good
Nate (2013-10-28 11:28) (2x <3): Phil and Xander are the tinder/night game boys
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:29): Sandeep is just in AWE of MGB
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:30): that's cool @ Nate and lol @ Phil
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:30): does the group share material
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:30): I'm the "how quickly can I get them to text/orbit me" guy
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:31): RSD stuff, old-school stuff, Manson Models?
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:31): lol thats cool
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:31): seems like a little asshole game on tinder can go a long wayyy
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:32): I'm not really into RSD
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:32): how about blogs
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:32): More CH, Roosh etc.
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:32): lol CH
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:32): its like the chemotherapy of this stuff
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:33): I'm not sure I follow your analogy
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:33) (1x <3): how the cure (chemo) might actually be worse than the illness itself
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:33): Haha
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:33): i actually like/follow CH a lot
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:34): but deep in the troves of the comments, a lot of bile.  A lot of good stuff too
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:34): but like in the wrong hands, it can do more harm than good at first
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:34): I ignore that shit, since most of those bile-filled dudes aren't getting laid
Nate (2013-10-28 11:34) (2x <3): I found out why that chick stood me up on friday.  She said she was waiting for me, and gave me her best friends number (guy).  When I called he acted like he had no idea what was going on.  Sounds like he was jealous.
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:34) (2x <3): I use my dark powers for good!
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 11:34): http://www.wantickets.com/Events/140343/THE-PLAYBOY-TERRACE-HALLOWEEN-BASH/
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:35) (1x <3): @Nate Female naivety?
Nate (2013-10-28 11:35) (1x <3): Probably.  She was surprised her 'best friend' would do that.  She texted me last night asking why I didn't show up.
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:36): looool
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:36) (3x <3): How could my bestest beta orbiter do that!?
Mark (2013-10-28 11:37) (3x <3): so, it looks like we're never going to meet Xandong
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:37): @Mark You're alright, kid. Drinks tomorrow
Mark (2013-10-28 11:37) (1x <3): some sort of cataclysmic chain reaction will occur once we are in the same room
Nate (2013-10-28 11:38): This girl is about an 8.5-9 brazilian.  She is pretty clueless :)
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:38): A singularity event perhaps
PropDres BigP (2013-10-28 11:39): Nate, do u still open with Ben&Charlies daygame opener or a modified version of that
Nate (2013-10-28 11:39) (1x <3): I really hope one of the numbers from yesterday pans out.  She was a baruch student.  This girl was a 9 with no makeup and just having been to a funeral.
Nate (2013-10-28 11:39): @Dre frequently
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:40): @PropDres BigP These days, I favor the Nilay Special
Nate (2013-10-28 11:40): lol
Nate (2013-10-28 11:40): You mean the 'creepy wooden' opener?
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:41) (1x <3): *Stop girl, eyes bugging they're so wide* "Oh my god!" *Claps hands together dramatically* "You're just the most beauuuutiful girl ever!"
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-28 11:41) (4x <3): PropDres BigP changed name to Pippy Long Sausage™
Xandong (2013-10-28 11:42): I'm Xander, and I approve this name change.
Nate (2013-10-28 11:47): @Xander that's in the category of "I'm just having fun and you're a witness' openers
Mark (2013-10-28 11:47) (2x <3): my best day time opener is 'are those space pants? because your ass is out of this world'
Nate (2013-10-28 11:48): @Mark that shit actually works too
Nate (2013-10-28 11:48): just have to say it like will smith would in the fresh prince
Nate (2013-10-28 11:49): daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn giiiiirrl
Mark (2013-10-28 11:50) (3x <3): oh so that's what i've been doing wrong... i've gone with a Christopher Walken interpretation thus far
Nate (2013-10-28 11:51) (1x <3): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzbVxxYI8
Nate (2013-10-28 11:53): 2:40 is what I mean :)
Nate (2013-10-28 11:54): I should do that more, I did stuff that for a while and it was so much fun.
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:55): that would so work
Nate (2013-10-28 11:55): it does
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:55): yeah and the woman would totally not do that
Nate (2013-10-28 11:55) (1x <3): One time I had a girl give me her number and tell me she wanted to go out the next day.  She was married and totally forgot.
Nate (2013-10-28 11:56): And I did it will smith style
Nate (2013-10-28 11:56): I still have no idea how to open bitchy russians tho.  I crash and burn so hard.
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:57) (2x <3): "girl you look so good I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of y'all 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 11:57): awesome
Nate (2013-10-28 11:57) (1x <3): okay, I will do that opener at lunch
Mark (2013-10-28 11:59) (4x <3): Two Russian look at clouds.
One see potato. Other see impossible dream.
Is same cloud.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 12:00): Hahaha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 12:00): Sup Closers
Nate (2013-10-28 12:01): Yo yo yo bro
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 12:01) (1x <3): It was like a mini-closers-meetup last Sat
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 12:01) (1x <3): Which was bad for getting into places but whatever, had fun
Nate (2013-10-28 12:01): yeah that was fun
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:03): me too
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:03) (2x <3): I had bareback fun
Nate (2013-10-28 12:03) (3x <3): Phil is a walking reason for pennicillin
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:07): @Nate You're gonna need to channel my spirit to open those bitchy Russians
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 12:07): Jimmy what r u going to do on thursday
Nate (2013-10-28 12:07): @Xander yeah I know.  Best I got Sunday was a russian chick telling me she wanted to be left alone.
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:07): @Nate That means that we have to have buttsex, by the way
Nate (2013-10-28 12:08): I'll lube up
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:08): No, don't. Or else my energy won't be transferred properly
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 12:08): Xandong
@Nate That means that we have to have buttsex, by the way

we have to have buttsex

buttsex
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 12:08) (1x <3): http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Seinfeld-Leaving.gif
Nate (2013-10-28 12:09): True, that kind of conversation should be saved for gaylife
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:10): Yes, save the trolling and anti-advice for them
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 12:13): OK, gymtime ladies
Nate (2013-10-28 12:14): I wish I ate breakfast, I'm so hungry but I wanna work out too
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:16): Am I the only one who thinks that MidnightGrundleBoy looks completely strung out in his picture?
Nate (2013-10-28 12:17): And those girls look pretty sober
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:17): Not trying to knock him, but they look pretty damn average
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:17): Okay, I am trying to knock him
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:18): yeah one of them was slightly below average
Nate (2013-10-28 12:18): Well if he had a threesome, it still would have been awesome
Nate (2013-10-28 12:18) (1x <3): 'if'
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:18): That's true. Would have been worth it then, for sure
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:19): Getting wasted or getting your dick wet. Which do you choose?
Nate (2013-10-28 12:19): the second
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:22): both
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:22): But if you're too wasted to get your dick wet, what then?
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:22): get stoned
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:23): lol. CRACK!
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:23): lol
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:23) (1x <3): I don't feel like working today
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:23) (1x <3): I never feel like working. Why do you think I'm always in here
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:24): haha yep 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:25): I got my date with that college girl I used to have a crush on
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:25): she has a very small chest but a really nice ass
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:25): if I remember correctly
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:25): I can work with that
Nate (2013-10-28 12:26) (3x <3): I used to date a girl with small tits.  She didn't wear a bra and you could see her nipples poking through her shirts often.  It was soooo hot.
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:26): http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cGGfEbHDhiwJ:www.rooshv.com/day-game-killed-my-night-game
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:28): idk I disagree with a lot of this
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:29): That's why I was posting it. I was wondering about all of your thoughts
Nate (2013-10-28 12:29): Well as someone who has on more than one occasion pulled a girl from the street back to my apartment the same day, there is no such thing as predictable 2 date lays
Nate (2013-10-28 12:30): although day and night definitely require different calibration
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:30): Yeah, I'm wondering how much of this is through the lens of being in countries other than America
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:31): Since he's basically been an ex-pat for several years
Nate (2013-10-28 12:31): also maybe he never tries to instadate
Nate (2013-10-28 12:32): He's right though, you can't spend energy on both very well.  There simple isn't enough time in the day
Nate (2013-10-28 12:33): *simply
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:33): the way I figure it 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:33): I can go out one or more nights a week 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:34): date the rest of the week
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:34): and day game in between
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:34): I realized this morning that I have grown very lazy because of all my dates
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:34) (1x <3): I'm not experiencing the "anxiety" that Roosh talks about when entering a venue
Nate (2013-10-28 12:35) (1x <3): @Phil that does get so busy tho that you get burnt out
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:36): I already know the girls are interested, so I'm not stressing at all
Nate (2013-10-28 12:37): I find when I go out at night, I'm not hungry so I don't push myself that hard.
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:38) (1x <3): I need to be aiming at the highest tiers so that I'm feeling frightened again
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:38): And maybe eliminating a ton of my easy leads
Nate (2013-10-28 12:38) (1x <3): Same can be said for my day stuff.  I feel I need to aim for higher tier women
Nate (2013-10-28 12:39): I've been hovering the 8 range for a lot of my girls
Nate (2013-10-28 12:39): occasional 9's and 7's
Xandong (2013-10-28 12:40) (1x <3): Also, I'm wondering if I smell like poo
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:45): hearts all around
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:45): I think 8+ is pretty good 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:45): after that I stop caring 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:46) (1x <3): unless they're a dream come true
Nate (2013-10-28 12:46): well in my mind the girl I marry is a 10, although that's not very realistic.  Personality counts for a lot more.
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:47): the girl I marry has to be a 9
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:47): at least
Phillatio (2013-10-28 12:47): but be bumped up by her personality
Nate (2013-10-28 12:49): I have to get really lucky to find a girl I want to marry.  The personality of the girls I truly fall in love with are rarely if ever single.
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:12): Since 10s don't exist
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:12): @Nate So you're never going to marry, is what you're sayin
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:13) (1x <3): I'm still confused as to why Sandeep is handing out advice
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:14): I think he's secretly trying to take over the Jersey group
Phillatio (2013-10-28 13:16): oh this is in jersey
Phillatio (2013-10-28 13:16): gaylife is dead today
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:17): Yeah, and thank god for that, too
Xandong (2013-10-28 13:17): Sometimes silence is golden
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 13:19): 



  
Xandong
I'm still confused as to why Sandeep is handing out advice
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:20): Sandeep
i think the point was - anywhere you like to hangout should be good enough for them. bring them into your life.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:20): 
Sandeep
David. You're the party. Take them to your place. Get drunk, play twister.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 13:20): it's common pattern.  It can be good unless the advice-giver doesn't understand what the actions/behaviors that caused an interaction to occur a certain way. 
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:21) (1x <3): I dont think sandeep has taken a girl to his place yet
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 13:21) (1x <3): t's common pattern.  It can be good unless the advice-giver doesn't understand what the actions/behaviors that caused an interaction to occur a certain way. 
Yeah you'll often see noobish types handing out advice as a way of giving it back.  It's also a way to validate-oneself as you're affirming your belief that you've leveled up in PUA when you can give out knowledge
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:22): Today hasnt been good day.
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:22): We all started somewhere
Maximus Decimus Meridius (2013-10-28 13:24): - Started with missing a Xander stop

Xandong (2013-10-28 14:14): Anyone interested in changing things up and heading to some hipster music shows in Brooklyn to snag some bitties this week?
Phillatio (2013-10-28 14:14): yes
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:18): Xander what do u have in mind
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:18): I keep getting invited to these free/cheap shows in Brooklyn by a guy I know from college, and when I look at the RSVP list, I see plenty of hot hipster chicks
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:19): Oh.
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:21) (1x <3): I always get asked to be on the guestlist for meatpacking clubs. Normal hot chicks that are always guaranteed to be there in very tiny dresses.
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:21): You're boring, Marcus
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:21): Haha
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:21): https://www.facebook.com/events/254209754727020/?ref=2&ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:21): Can anyone see that?
Nate (2013-10-28 14:21) (1x <3): yeah I hate short dresses on girls who have bathed in the last 4 days
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:22): You know, I'm surprised by the lack of adventure in this room
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:23): I love adventure, but I hate Brooklyn
Nate (2013-10-28 14:23) (1x <3): I just like sarcasm
Mark (2013-10-28 14:25) (2x <3): love me some tattooed bitches from Brooklyn.. most of them smoke like a chimney, that's why we get along
Nate (2013-10-28 14:26): I don't like tattoos, but I do like pussy
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:26): @Mark Is this perhaps our time to rendezvous?
Mark (2013-10-28 14:27) (1x <3): you need to move into the city, pronto
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:27) (1x <3): I like that tattoos signify sexual promiscuity, not marriage material
Mark (2013-10-28 14:27): so we can do day stuff
Mark (2013-10-28 14:27) (1x <3): *gay stuff
Mark (2013-10-28 14:28): i wouldn't mind settling down with a girl with a tattoo... they can be tasteful y'know
Mark (2013-10-28 14:29): it's not all dolphins with unicorns and sprinkles tramp stamps
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:29): Why did we take a limo to 230 5th on saturday?
Mark (2013-10-28 14:29) (1x <3): because we can
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:29): :)
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:30): The real question: Why didn't you ride around in the limo and pull girls into it?
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:30): my god that fat chick wanted one of the marks
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:30) (2x <3): Sorry Nate that u had to make out with her
Mark (2013-10-28 14:30) (1x <3): god, i wanted to eject that fat cunt out of the sunroof so bad
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:31): MeTOO

Marcus (2013-10-28 14:31): YUP IT SUCKED
Mark (2013-10-28 14:31) (2x <3): she must've reeked of yeast and sweat

Phillatio (2013-10-28 14:41): hmm 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 14:41): yeah you should
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:43) (1x <3): yeah. But she is trying to lead
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:43) (1x <3): Why she trying to be a man
Nate (2013-10-28 14:43) (2x <3): Translation: I don't know if I like you, so I don't want to waste my evening
Mark (2013-10-28 14:44) (2x <3): fuck she's gaming me
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:45) (2x <3): Aight bitch hit me up wen u feel like suckin dick
Nate (2013-10-28 14:45): 'awkwardly long or late' - hahahaha she's already assuming you're gonna be awkward.  If you agree to what's she's asking you are effectively agreeing
Mark (2013-10-28 14:45): maybe she's a pro and just hedging her bets, idk
Nate (2013-10-28 14:46) (1x <3): she sounds anal.  Not that i'm good at this, but I'd call her ass out on it.
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:47) (2x <3): Yes, call her ass out for some anal
Nate (2013-10-28 14:47) (1x <3): I wouldn't go for coffee with her.  she sounds like someone who needs a few drinks to get the stick out of her ass
Mark (2013-10-28 14:48): agreed
Mark (2013-10-28 14:48) (3x <3): i'll just play the 'i work late, drinks only' card
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:48): A sound proposal. Catch the end of happy hour
Nate (2013-10-28 14:48): I had a girl insist that I take her only to coffee or dinner.  I tried a few suggestions and then said forget it, I won't like you.
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:49) (1x <3): Irish Coffee?
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:49) (1x <3): @Nate That's when you demand mini golf
Nate (2013-10-28 14:50): I tried 'let's take a walk in the park' and she flat out said 'coffee or dinner only'
Mark (2013-10-28 14:50): Russian?
Nate (2013-10-28 14:50): korean
Mark (2013-10-28 14:50): was about to guess that next
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:50) (1x <3): Dinner: The romance killer
Nate (2013-10-28 14:51) (1x <3): She was receptive to me telling her that her ass looked hot in that short skirt, but wouldn't go for drinks.  Wierd girl
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:51): Draws the blood to the stomach and away from the genitals
Mark (2013-10-28 14:51) (1x <3): there are a select group of cunts who would like nothing more than to suck the bitcoins out of you... and they tend to fall within a few ethnic groups
Nate (2013-10-28 14:51): Well I found a good dinner place.  Conveyer belt sushi.  Actually a fun date.
Mark (2013-10-28 14:52): can we go for sushi buffet
Mark (2013-10-28 14:52) (1x <3): i'll put out, i promise
Nate (2013-10-28 14:52): I'm up for a closers outing tomorrow for lunch
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:52): Shit...
Mark (2013-10-28 14:52): lemme guess, you can't make it
Marcus (2013-10-28 14:53): Maybe dinner
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:53): I don't even get lunch off
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:53): We eat here
Mark (2013-10-28 14:53): jesus, i thought slavery had been abolished
Nate (2013-10-28 14:53): Someone has to feed the omega
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:53): You may have been mistaken, massa!
Mark (2013-10-28 14:53): so the omega really is the alpha then?
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:54) (2x <3): @Mark he's the alpha parasite
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:55): And these are supposed to be the people we tolerate in an "enlightened" society
Mark (2013-10-28 14:56): we let the betas find mates so that society can benefit from their labor
Nate (2013-10-28 14:56): No usually people like that are encouraged to play World of Warcraft and never leave their apartment
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:56) (1x <3): We should turn the omegas into dog food!
Nate (2013-10-28 14:57): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sp-VFBbjpE
Xandong (2013-10-28 14:57): They are encouraged to work night stocking at Wal-Mart
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:03): Turns out that it wasn't me that the shit smell was emanating from. I forgot about the mouse trap under my chair...
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:04): ah and there's a dead desiccated mouse in there
Nate (2013-10-28 15:04): ewww
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:04) (1x <3): looks like you found omega's lunch
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:08): @Phillatio I wouldn't say desiccated. It was still quite moist looking
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:09): juicy
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:09): mmmm
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 15:11): dessicate...nice word
Nate (2013-10-28 15:11): And you said you don't get paid for this job?  Sounds like a dream.
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:12): seriously though @Xandong are you getting a new job anytime soon
Nate (2013-10-28 15:14): @Xandong you program in javascript right?
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:14): Uhhh, not yet. I have only made my way through like half of a Codecademy course on it
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:14): @Nate I get paid, just not as much as I would like
Nate (2013-10-28 15:15): ahh okay
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:15): In fact, they paid for my current hell hole
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:15) (2x <3): so after you finish codeacedemy read javascript the good parts
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:15): I can let you borrow it
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:15): Wheeeee! Help a nigga out!
Nate (2013-10-28 15:17): I wanna actually hear agent smith say that
Nate (2013-10-28 15:18) (3x <3): I wish groupme had tab autocomplete for names
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:18): wow yeah that would be an awesome feature
Nate (2013-10-28 15:19): I'm so used to it from irc I still do it by accident sometimes
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:19): I gave them feedback
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:19): and asked for that
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:19): I've complained about other shit on groupme before
Nate (2013-10-28 15:19): Me too
Nate (2013-10-28 15:20): Okay here's one.  At work I can only have one window open and I can switch between them by clicking the tab at the top.  At home I can't have that, but I can have 2 windows open at once.
Nate (2013-10-28 15:20): No idea why
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21): oh yeah I've seen both
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21): I like having two windows I thought they removed that feature
Nate (2013-10-28 15:21): No it still works at home like that
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21) (1x <3): oh did you try to press the three dots
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21): on the top right
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21): then try opening another chat
Nate (2013-10-28 15:21): oh, haha
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:21): yeah I just figured that out too
Nate (2013-10-28 15:22): I never would have guessed that
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:22): What an intuitive interface!
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:23): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:23) (1x <3): so I can't listen to choral or band music without getting really upset 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 15:23): I guess I miss it more than I thought
Nate (2013-10-28 15:24): you used to play the symbols in college?
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:24): @Phillatio I really miss choral singing

Nate (2013-10-28 15:40) (1x <3): "Old enough to get away with it" -> "Did I do something?  Where am I?  What year is it?"
Nate (2013-10-28 15:40): Yeah I've never left the state, except for traveling
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 15:41) (1x <3): so do most people work in coding/software development

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 15:42): lol
Nate (2013-10-28 15:42): The difference is when I tell a girl I'm a male stripper, she isn't sure if I'm lying.
Mark (2013-10-28 15:42): chicks dig ass burgers
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:43) (1x <3): @Phil So I take that as a yes for some Brooklyn vaginal spelunking this weekend?

Nate (2013-10-28 15:44) (1x <3): I might be up for slumming it this weekend, too early to tell
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:47): Friday or Saturday? Looks like there are two events
Nate (2013-10-28 15:49): where are the events?
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:51): The Friday one is TBA the day of...
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:51): And the Saturday one is at Alaska, some dive bar
Nate (2013-10-28 15:52): The morgan stop, you weren't kidding about hipster
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:52) (1x <3): Apparently, Alaska has bourbon milkshakes. Now that sounds tasty
Nate (2013-10-28 15:52): I know a tattood girl that lives near there
Mark (2013-10-28 15:53) (6x <3): don't we all
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:54): Oh, and there is also a Thursday Halloween night at Alaska, which may be the most promising of all
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:55): That's in the same series, btw. This dude is like the hipster promoter

Mark (2013-10-28 15:58) (1x <3): although i just go there for frogger and ignore all the chicks
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:59): Bleh, if I'm going to Barcade, might as well just go to the one in Jersey City
Nate (2013-10-28 15:59) (1x <3): Yeah but then I'd have to go to Jersey
Xandong (2013-10-28 15:59) (3x <3): I'm not talking about YOU, cumgums.
Xandong (2013-10-28 16:01): >:-O
Nate (2013-10-28 16:01): I just assumed all the girls in jersey looked like Kitty
Marcus (2013-10-28 16:03) (1x <3): Go to hoboken on friday night, all the girls are 6- & think they are 9+
Xandong (2013-10-28 16:04): I have seen the occasional cutie in Jersey City at Barcade or Lucky 7...
Xandong (2013-10-28 16:05): But the hot girls are usually ghetto fab and with guys who look like ex-cons
Marcus (2013-10-28 16:06): there is a few clubs in hoboken that i think have a few 8+ 
Marcus (2013-10-28 16:08): Does a 8pm street approach count as day game (she was leaving her yoga class)

Xandong (2013-10-28 16:29): *Omega Prime
Nate (2013-10-28 16:31) (1x <3): I don't like that name, it takes away from the awesomeness that is optimus prime

Xandong (2013-10-28 16:50): That's winnnnnnn
Nate (2013-10-28 16:50): change his profile pic to pedobear
Xandong (2013-10-28 16:50) (1x <3): And it would probably go over in this context, since I already did that several texts ago
Mark (2013-10-28 16:51) (2x <3): Sandeep would say something like "I'm so sorry about the other night! Please forgive me! I'll make it up to you i promise!!!"
Phillatio (2013-10-28 16:51) (1x <3): sandeep would never get to this point

Mark (2013-10-28 17:08) (3x <3): gaylife is so dead today that we've resorted to trolling this chat
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:12): lol
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:16): Man, everything Sandeep says is depressing
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:16) (1x <3): Even him talking about not having a costume
Nate (2013-10-28 17:17): I know, there are 4 fucking days till halloween, get a costume bitch
Nate (2013-10-28 17:18) (2x <3): It's not like mine was the height of awesome, but I owned it

Nate (2013-10-28 17:27): Has he actually slept with a woman?
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:27): skinny > fat
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:27) (1x <3): @Nate I believe that he has, but they are few and far between. Also, they usually run for the hills once they pick up on his weirdness
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:28) (1x <3): @Mark You can go as Toad
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:29): Xander when did u join the gotham chat

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:31): sh1t prob in july/aug
Nate (2013-10-28 17:31): I don't think I was that far off from them either
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:31): I joined after Mark, since he was already in the middle of his 30 day challenge
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:31): That's when I stumbled onto them and started the reaping for Closers
Mark (2013-10-28 17:31): i remember you had a handsomer avatar back then Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:31) (1x <3): Mark, Props broooooo
Nate (2013-10-28 17:32) (2x <3): Yeah I know, but it was too handsome for the chat.  Kept getting cock pics from the members
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:32) (1x <3): regarding ur 30 day challenge
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:32): ah okay Jimmy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:32): i felt like ive been out of the loop so long
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:32): not that i miss gotham per se, it was a big part of me a while back
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:32) (1x <3): some weird characters in there man lol
Nate (2013-10-28 17:32): @Dre you have, jimmy had to remind me who you were.  It was that long.
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:33): Who was Sleiveen? A former mod?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:33): We say mod, he said god
Nate (2013-10-28 17:33): I say dog
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:33): Like, he was actually insane?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:33): nah man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): he was a former nerd, uncalibrated, went on a power trip
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): assumed a role he wasnt' ready for, and he eventually got checked
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): like the water boy trying to be QB
Nate (2013-10-28 17:34): so basically grundle boy?
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:34): I didn't mean insanely good at pickup, I meant insane as in delusions of grandeur
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): meh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): grundle boi goes out.  Sleveen would rant about this asian wench he met online and that was it
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:34): Weir
Nate (2013-10-28 17:34): oh okay
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:34): i mean, if u just do online dating...okay. but the way he talked about it
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:35): Hence, our current group icon
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:35) (1x <3): Sleiveen ragged on daygame saying it wasn't worth the time investment.  He dated asian uggs and thought himself to be the Ghengis Khan of pickup. 
Nate (2013-10-28 17:36): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:36): yeah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:36): important question
Nate (2013-10-28 17:36) (1x <3): Yep day game is totally not worth my time, nope
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:36): where do u see urself with this llong-term
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:36) (1x <3): He gave me the boot when I posted a pic in the chat...and shit started to hit the fan
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:36): does gaming wear down on u?  i know initially its exhilerating, all this newfound power and reponses u get
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:36): trying to see where everyone is at.  Curious
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:37): I understand the argument for daygame over nightgame, but that's because it's actually debatable
Nate (2013-10-28 17:37) (2x <3): @pippy with a beautiful, fun wife who likes to share me with other women.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:37): that's cool man
Nate (2013-10-28 17:37) (1x <3): @Xandong getting good at either will bring you a lot of success
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:37): i think a lot of the journey depends on where u start out
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:37): I'm experiencing a certain degree of #PlayerBurnout at the moment
Mark (2013-10-28 17:37): yeah basically the goal is to have 3 quality women you keep in a rotation and have an open relationship with all of them
Mark (2013-10-28 17:38): aka personal harem
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:38): 1) Social status in high-school college 2) How fuc.ked up you are internally 3) What your insecurities are 4) How you stack up as a man 5) How u stack up as a potential PUA
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:38): I was a natural in college, then I fell from grace for several years
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:38): I could work with that @MArk
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:38): that's cool
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:38): I was a natural in high school but I lost all my social status 
Nate (2013-10-28 17:38): I was a horrible shutin in college who got attacked constantly going to and from school
Nate (2013-10-28 17:39): err high school
Nate (2013-10-28 17:39): not college
Mark (2013-10-28 17:39) (1x <3): same here Phil... i devolved into a beta vag after my most recent 4 yr relationship
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:39): I had low social status in high school, high-ish/sexy outsider status in college
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:39): beta vag after my most recent 4 yr relationship
Nate (2013-10-28 17:40) (1x <3): Girls were all over me in high school, but I was too preoccupied with not dying to be able to take advantage of it much
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:40): yeah, the emotional shock that ends with being dumped is a common factor
Hot Thongs (2013-10-28 17:40): hey pippy
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:40) (1x <3): I've never been dumped
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:40): how about friends? Did most of u have natural friends growing up?
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:40): Basically, the tendencies I have needed to weed out are more gamma than beta
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:40): seems like it takes a lot longer to know what works what doesnt if u arent exposed to i t
Mark (2013-10-28 17:40) (1x <3): well i dumped her, but still, game got uber rusty
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:40): Hey Hot Thongs, sup
Hot Thongs (2013-10-28 17:40): glad to see you in here, you gave some really good articles
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:40): I had plenty of friends growing up
Hot Thongs (2013-10-28 17:40): when i asked some questions a few times
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:40): @ht, CHEERS
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:41): same ^
Nate (2013-10-28 17:41): I've always had friends.  I still have some of the same friends, although we see each other less
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:41): @Xandong
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:41): yeah, Xander.  perhaps u just haev to undo some subpar behaviors/habits that's all
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:41): u might reach ur end-state a lot sooner than u think
Nate (2013-10-28 17:41): @pippy I feel like you're writing an article for Vanity Fair
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:41): date tonight lunch date tomorrow and date tomorrow night 
Mark (2013-10-28 17:42) (2x <3): i have plenty of friends, but none of them treat pickup like a science
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:42): gonna be a good week
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:42): 



  
Nate @pippy I feel like you're writing an article for Vanity Fair
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:42): lol naw, just legit curious as to where everyone's head is at
Nate (2013-10-28 17:42) (1x <3): Well actually as friends go, you are the ones I see the most now.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:42): it's hella interesting. no more surprises or wtf moemnts when u understand where soemone is coming from
Mark (2013-10-28 17:42) (2x <3): Nate *group hug*
Mark (2013-10-28 17:43) (3x <3): us degenerates gotta stick together
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:43): haha yeah that's pretty much true for me as well
Nate (2013-10-28 17:43): most of my close friends got married and had kids, so they are in a very different place
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:43): I just see you guys more because I want to game
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:44): not that I wouldn't hang out if I got into some shit
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:44): obviously
Nate (2013-10-28 17:44) (4x <3): Also you guys are the kind of folks I like being around, because you're positive and driven
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:44): aw
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:45): Ask yourself if you're coming from a more beta or a more gamma background:
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:45): http://krauserpua.com/2012/12/08/thy-name-is-gamma/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:45): Denied Access arghhhhhhhhh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:45): ya seems familiar,will check out later if i remember
Nate (2013-10-28 17:46): @Xandong probably a little of both
Nate (2013-10-28 17:46) (1x <3): scratch that, I actually read the article, I'm not at all gamma
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:48): no you're not ^
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:48): Not allowed to browse Adult themes category
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:48): Sucks
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:48): I used to seethe with anger at the world, so full of injustice!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:48): lol yeah?
Nate (2013-10-28 17:48): I used to think I was cursed and god was toying with me
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:48): @Pippy thanks finished my 30 days (more like 40) in europe
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:48): Congrats Marcus!
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:49): Xander u finished 30 days right
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:49): Thanks
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:49) (1x <3): I thought everyone else was an idiot and that I was smarter than all of them
Mark (2013-10-28 17:49): but you still do
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:49) (3x <3): Now I know that that's only mostly true
Nate (2013-10-28 17:49) (1x <3): and that Xander is why we get along
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:50) (1x <3): One of the best things a wing can do for you, is to help get you in state.  This applies on both  a micro level (during a night out at the bar when you can't approach for shit), and on a macro level (where you're in a serious slump w/ women and feel like you have no single attractive quality).  

To that end, it's a good investment of time to grab a drink w/ your wing, talk about shit other than pickup, see where you can help each other out. 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:50): When I see good PUAs who are also great wings w/ each other, they seem to have that in common. 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:50): i think i understand where ur coming from
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:51): in a serious slump w/ women and feel like you have no single attractive quality).  
Nate (2013-10-28 17:51): Speaking of other things, lets do a group lunch tomorrow
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:51): yes this is true @Jummyayo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:51) (1x <3): ugh Jimmy, i didnt come here to get a case of the feels...
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:51): hah jummy
Nate (2013-10-28 17:51): *sniff
Marcus (2013-10-28 17:51): DINNER 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:51): And this is a huge factor in me creating a tighter knit subgroup
Mark (2013-10-28 17:51) (1x <3): sushi buffet pls
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:51): begs the question though
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:51): yeah I think I was a bit beta but I was never a gamma 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:51): and this is somewhat rhetorical
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:52): if the group is founded on pick-up, it's identity is on pursuing women
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:52) (2x <3): Jimmy: "People who you wouldn't be embarrassed to grab a beer with"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:52): it's difficult to talk about anything but
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:52): @Xander lol
Nate (2013-10-28 17:52): @pippy stay in this chat for a while, we go on tangents pretty often
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:52): Yeah, I was never quite as bad as that article portrays. Don't really understand some of the acting feminine assertions
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:53): Except that maybe feeling sorry for yourself is a very feminine trait
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): or the actually looks
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): I don't think you're looks are effected 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): your*
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): affected*
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): fuck
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:53): I'm bad at english today
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:53): Yeah. That's some kind of phrenology shit
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 17:53) (4x <3): http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Brotato_c107c3_1542949.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:54): Oh gawd
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:55) (2x <3): Winnnnnnnnnnnn might be the first man to reach 1000 approaches without a single bang
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:55): Which is pretty much like winning the lottery, statistically
Mark (2013-10-28 17:55) (3x <3): see, i don't know if i'd call them proper approaches... they're more like 'nice shoes, wanna fuck?'
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:56): he'll get there by 2000
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:56): eventually a girl is gonna be like "yes"
Phillatio (2013-10-28 17:56): and he'll be so surprised he won't know what to do
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:57): "B-but... I thought it was all about approaching..."
Nate (2013-10-28 17:57): It's possible to be in this game, but not actually want to succeed subconsciously...
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:57): Sandeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 17:57): @Dre "it's difficult to talk about anything but"

Definitely, and that's fine...but we are also normal, cool guys; the Closers members list has been specifically curated to that end. 

Meaning, I think we can manage to have other conversations in addition to talking about pickup
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:57): I summon you!
Mark (2013-10-28 17:58) (2x <3): Sandeep's avatar just gets more and more alpha over time
Nate (2013-10-28 17:58): this needs to be his avatar:
Nate (2013-10-28 17:58) (2x <3): http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110408171817/muppet/images/9/96/Tumblr-SnuffyDancing.png
Xandong (2013-10-28 17:58): I mean, if you're a super alpha motherfucker, an avatar like that can only help you
Mark (2013-10-28 17:58) (1x <3): yeah you don't want to be overqualifying yourself
Nate (2013-10-28 17:59) (1x <3): It takes a real pua to make your avatar pedobear
Mark (2013-10-28 17:59): don't tempt me
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:00) (2x <3): Heh heh
Nate (2013-10-28 18:00): lol
Mark (2013-10-28 18:00): Nate what have you done
Nate (2013-10-28 18:01): muhahaha

Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:01): fuck 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:01): I was gonna do that @Xandong
Nate (2013-10-28 18:01): damn, that didn't paste
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:02): yeah  no .jpg on the end
Nate (2013-10-28 18:02): http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTUMg_jwufa1vwNRWGwxumsjEqbKT68k_q9TJa1V5RcJiboze42jw.jpg
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:02) (1x <3): Hmm
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:02): http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTUMg_jwufa1vwNRWGwxumsjEqbKT68k_q9TJa1V5RcJiboze42jw.jpeg
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:02): that didn't work either
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:02): lol @xandong

Nate (2013-10-28 18:02): there 
Nate (2013-10-28 18:03): jeesh
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:03): The other picture was too washed out
Nate (2013-10-28 18:03): yeah I know
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:03): Gotta have some standards around here, people
Nate (2013-10-28 18:03) (1x <3): wait, so Ltd had a part time job only and was whining about not being able to ever do game?
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:03): aparently
Nate (2013-10-28 18:04) (1x <3): I lose more respect for that guy every day
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:04): Nate
It's possible to be in this game, but not actually want to succeed subconsciously...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:04): 100%
Nate (2013-10-28 18:04): I should know, I was there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:05): seriously?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:05): howd u get past that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:05) (1x <3): i have a friend that wants to know...
Nate (2013-10-28 18:05): yeah.  I hit a low point and decided I didn't want to be a lose anymore
Nate (2013-10-28 18:05): loser
Mark (2013-10-28 18:05) (4x <3): so... lunch tomorrow? :D
Nate (2013-10-28 18:05) (1x <3): I had to hit rock bottom
Nate (2013-10-28 18:05): lol
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:06): wtf @mark 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:06): I'm not switching fuck that
Nate (2013-10-28 18:06): Yes lunch PedoMark
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:06): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:06): Nate, i hear u
Nate (2013-10-28 18:06): When I first joined the chat I was still whining about being cursed.
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:07): I think that hitting rock bottom is a big part of it
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:07): Going out with GothamLife guys pulled me out of another deepening depression
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:08): rock-bottom is huge
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:08): emotional impetus that serves as an ass-kick
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:08): what do u do tho
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:08): Happiness is out there for the taking, but you have to be the one who seizes it
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:08): It's meaningless if someone tries to hand it to you
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:08): when u've gotten to the plateau of "Meh, I don't have to stress it. I'm okay. Not getting the results I want thouhg"
Nate (2013-10-28 18:08) (1x <3): There's a point where the fear of success/failure is overcome by a realization you don't want to be that person anymore
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:08): cause u balance being content with oneself yet yearning for more
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:09) (1x <3): well your happiness can't be dependent on game
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:09): It isn't
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:09) (1x <3): you need other outlets 
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:09): well not you specifically
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:09) (1x <3): It just helped me pull myself out of a hole
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:09): Phillatio

  

  

  
  

  well your happiness can't be dependent on game
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:09): lets be honest
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:10): yes lets
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:10) (1x <3): how many instantly feel better after piositive interaction/number close, etc
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:10): http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s49/Mr_Muggles/GIFS/1s008i.gif
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:10): That's a cheap, fleeting happiness
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:10): Yeah, you need other outlets, like exercise and harem maintenance
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:10): It's a drug
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:10): okay I'm going home
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:11): so I can hit on more girls
Phillatio (2013-10-28 18:11): bye guys
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:11): later Phil-dawg
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:11): Contentment can be sustained
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-28 18:11): Hot Thongs changed name to D-money
Nate (2013-10-28 18:11) (2x <3): My happiness came yesterday when a girl apologized for not showing up because of her gamma best friend boy being a little bitch
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:11): Shit... maybe I shouldn't have self-identified with being somewhat gamma in the past
Xandong (2013-10-28 18:12): I am forever marked!
Nate (2013-10-28 18:12): GammaDong
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-10-28 18:12): Xandong changed name to Xander Xone
Mark (2013-10-28 18:12) (1x <3): i'll mark you Xandong, just say the word
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:12): Who wants a mushroom stamp?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:13): risky google search of the day!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:13): Let's say one gets better w/ this stuff, starts shagging lots more women.  And the women he's fucking are getting hotter and hotter
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:14): Now his expectations will be so much higher, he will no longer be happy w/ a 7 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:14): http://i.imgur.com/gDRka.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:14): Go on Jimmy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:14): Will he ever fuck a girl and find himself truly happy?
Mark (2013-10-28 18:14) (1x <3): greatest reward for me is finding a woman who you have a deep, genuine connection with... while maintaining an open relationship
Nate (2013-10-28 18:15): Sure, with a 9
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:15): that is the pussy paradox Jimmy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:15): or one of them
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:15): That's a great reward, sure
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:15): But don't focus your happiness on it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:15): If and when it comes, enjoy the shit out of it
Mark (2013-10-28 18:16): i'd like to be able to spend time with a girl in a non-bar/club setting and just enjoy her presence
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:16): Ah yes, it's the hedonic treadmill, the wheel of samsara.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:17): But the only way you'll attain real happiness in this ridiculous journey of ours...isn't to bang the hottest girl you can, but rather to become the person that you want to become.  The self-improvement aspect of pickup.
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:17): It's doubtful I would ever settle down with a 9. The maintenance effort required would be too great
Mark (2013-10-28 18:17) (2x <3): most 9/10s are good for a few bangs and then they have nothing to offer
Mark (2013-10-28 18:17): their value proposition is very upfront
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:18) (1x <3): You're may be chained to the Wheel of Samsara with iron chains or golden ones, but you're still chained.
Mark (2013-10-28 18:21) (1x <3): but yeah for me, pickup is just a hobby, career will always be #1 priority for me
Mark (2013-10-28 18:21) (1x <3): i just so happen to have an obsessive personality, so whatever it is i get into, i get really into it
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:21): Amen
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:21): word up
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:21): until you don't feel as deficient with it no mo'
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:22): For me i'm trying my damnedest to put my friends/family back up higher on my priority list
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:23): I think pickup started making me really selfish and neglected/alienated myself from them
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:24): DAT FAMILY GUILT
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:24): the worst
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:26): Yeah, I have been neglecting my family some too
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:26): And my career... definitely
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:27): all good bru
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:27): u can only get so far until you stop and focus on another area
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:29): I have been neglecting my girls too, but that doesn't seem to be negatively affecting anything
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:31): They just love me all the more!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-28 18:33): Filed under #Aloof Asshole game

Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:35) (1x <3): D-money I think winnnnnnnnnn is looking for a sarge partner tonight  ;)
Jimmyayo (2013-10-28 18:37): My folks are finally leaving tomorrow morning, so I have one last dinner w/ them tonight.  Then I am a free man
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 18:38): @D-money Might as well actively get worse at game rather than passively

Xander Xone (2013-10-28 21:18): 
Sandeep
I didn't feel awkward and didn't act it. chatted as usual. there was silence for a while, then she told me she broke up with her BF after that night. and was sorry for ignoring my texts.
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 21:19): i had no idea she had a bf and she just came to US 2 months ago. she said it was a bf of 4 years. so I'm assuming long distance. anyway - again didnt react at all really. just said 'oh that must be tough breaking up. thanks for letting me know." and chatted about her halloween plan. she had none. said she's free from Thursday onwards. Said I
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 21:19): 
Said i'm busy Thr night, but we
We'll go out Friday.
then - asked her if Friday works for her, she agreed. and then her stop arrived. haven't texted yet to confirm. (will wait til tmrw, 2 days after this story)
Xander Xone (2013-10-28 21:19):

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:36) (1x <3): Your women will be slaves. Your sons, your daughters, your elders will be slaves, but not you. By noon this day, you will all be dead men! The thousand nations of the Persian Empire descend upon you! Our arrows will blot out the sun!

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 11:43): cheers.  I'll be back with more as time progresses but that is enough for today
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:43): I would say post this shit in GayLife, but I don't think that it would make much of a difference.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 11:44): yeah it prob wouldn't be as impactful
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:47): @Phillatio Have you met Fox in real life?
Nate (2013-10-29 11:47): It's funny I read these comments and hear carbon copies of my situation at different stages
Phillatio (2013-10-29 11:47): nope
Phillatio (2013-10-29 11:47): I honestly don't have too much time to read during the day
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:47): I want to see his ugly mug!
Phillatio (2013-10-29 11:47): I just checked out his gotham pic
Phillatio (2013-10-29 11:48) (1x <3): I mean he's not hideous for fucks sake. just not as good looking as me or you
Nate (2013-10-29 11:49) (1x <3): Neither am I you adonis
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:51) (2x <3): That's okay. Looking pretty is for women, fags and metros
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:52) (1x <3): I was watching 300 yesterday with Newport Mark and thinking that it would be awesome to have a scar across my eye
Nate (2013-10-29 11:53) (1x <3): Ohh, did he put out?
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:54): @Nate He was playing hard to get
Nate (2013-10-29 11:54): bitch
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:56): I don't like losing my hair, but I'm not willing to fuck up my sex hormones and possibly go impotent for mere vanity
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:56): I'm probably going to be bald as an egg in a decade
Nate (2013-10-29 11:57): Context?
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:57): Looks
Nate (2013-10-29 11:57): What do looks have to do with sex hormones?
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:57): Taking finasteride for hair loss
Phillatio (2013-10-29 11:59) (2x <3): you might as well just graph all your chest hair on your head
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:59): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 11:59) (3x <3): I think I'm just going to focus on gaining 30lb of muscle
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 11:59) (1x <3): what about shaving, maintaining a 2-3 facial hair stubble and getting jacked
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:00) (2x <3): Women don't even know what they want, since their brains are screwy
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:00): That's why it's up to us to take the lead, gentlemen
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:00): so how does one go about gaining 30lbs of muscle, it's no small feat
TiMex (2013-10-29 12:03): Hard work
TiMex (2013-10-29 12:04) (1x <3): That's approx my goal over the next 5 years
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:04): right hard work no doubt
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:04): in terms of a workout plan
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:04): Tom Hardy (guy who played Bane) is the exact same frame as me
Nate (2013-10-29 12:04): My goal right now is to lose my fat and get my back in better shape so I can workout without hurting myself
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:04): He bulked up to 200lb
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:05): whats ur starting weight an where do u want to get to, how long do u give urself?
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:05): And not by being on the BBW diet
Nate (2013-10-29 12:05) (1x <3): I don't eat big black women
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 12:05): http://www.returnofkings.com/19272/
Nate (2013-10-29 12:06): big and beautiful don't go together, fatass
TiMex (2013-10-29 12:06): Haha yea I always hated the term bbw
Nate (2013-10-29 12:06) (1x <3): going home for lunch today to do insanity
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:07): yeah, so Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:07): what's ur goal, what do u want to look like. Then go from there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:07): r/fitness lurrrves Starting Strength and all that
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:14): you know all of these super mpuas came from so far down the food chain
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:14): like sandeep level 
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:15): @Pippy Long Sausage™ reading those links you posted
Mark (2013-10-29 12:16): that BBW food pyramid link made me drool
Nate (2013-10-29 12:16) (3x <3): Wasn't that long ago I was sandeep level.  Eventually if he persists he'll be pretty good
Mark (2013-10-29 12:16): is nick youngblood any good
Mark (2013-10-29 12:17): need more daygame partners
Nate (2013-10-29 12:17): he's naturally charismatic, very young, but kinda passive with women
Nate (2013-10-29 12:17) (1x <3): he approaches though so he's 10x better off than most of that chat
Mark (2013-10-29 12:18): white guy?
Nate (2013-10-29 12:18): ya
Mark (2013-10-29 12:18): alright as long as he isn't a leper
Nate (2013-10-29 12:18): nope, although he's not very tall
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:18): lol
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:19): that's what Sexyreddituser told me he was like before I met him
Mark (2013-10-29 12:19): still haven't met that guy
Mark (2013-10-29 12:19): he kinda dropped off the map
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:19): he said he looked like Quasimoto 
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:19): yeah he did
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:20): idk what his deal is
Nate (2013-10-29 12:20): sru went out a lot, but he was very awkward, and way too focused on the goal and not the journey
Mark (2013-10-29 12:20): hm
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:21): he's not as awkward anymore
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:21): at least when I met him but he definetly is still way too focused on the goal
Mark (2013-10-29 12:22): Nate, do you have any more good qualification resources
Nate (2013-10-29 12:22): I'll look when I get home
Mark (2013-10-29 12:23): you were right about that one thing, more qualification leads to less lmr
Mark (2013-10-29 12:23) (1x <3): i've been doing more of it lately and it's working out quite well
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:23): 
Nate
sru went out a lot, but he was very awkward, and way too focused on the goal and not the journey
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:23): @Nate, what do u mean by that
Nate (2013-10-29 12:24) (1x <3): His mine was always on finding 'the one', so he was never in the present on what he was doing.
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:24): and he hates the chat 
Nate (2013-10-29 12:25) (1x <3): You can't be successful if everything you think about while you're talking to a girl is your marriage, 3 kids and a dog
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:25) (1x <3): he doesn't really want to know any of us
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:25): it makes it awkward gaming with him
Nate (2013-10-29 12:26): I ran into him a bunch of times, but never stayed with him for more than 5 minutes.  He wasn't fun to be around.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:26) (1x <3): i think i read via Krauser one time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:26) (1x <3): of the three types of daygamers, guys like SRU who were constantly on the prowl int he way he did it eventually became a bit bitter and hard to be around
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:28): The key is that you have to understand what exactly your plateau/rut is about. What’s the thing that’s quiety nagging at you?
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:28): solid advice
Nate (2013-10-29 12:28): I disagree a little with what you said.  It wasn't about being constantly on the prowl (which I usually am).  It's about enjoying what you're doing.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:28): how did u enjoy what u were doing in the initial phase of more failures than success
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:28): I sometimes feel like I'm in a rut
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:29): right now
Nate (2013-10-29 12:29): @pippy stop making success the goal, and start having fun with it.  Be self amusing.  Try things for the sake of having fun.
Nate (2013-10-29 12:30) (2x <3): I've reached another plateau, I know that.  I still need work on teasing, being more of a challenge to women, and texting, and a little not being needy.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:30): ya
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:30): from what you've said on here I'd say that's about right
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:30): @Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:31): i think thats you're constantly battling inner game versus outer game
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:31): its pretty similar problems for me too 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:31): if u improve ur outer game a lot but u still dont feel entitled to those successes (bangs) and are ejecting or sabotaging urself, then back to the drawing table to figure out why that it is and focus on that
Nate (2013-10-29 12:31): I'm not really sure at this point the best way to get past my plateau
Nate (2013-10-29 12:32): @phil I actually think you also sound like you have qualification issues
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:32): yeah definitely
Nate (2013-10-29 12:32): you're better at being a challenge than me tho definitely
Nate (2013-10-29 12:34): As embarrassed as I am to say this, I also still have a small fear of being bad in bed, and it comes out sometimes
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:35): hm yeah I'm pretty sure those fears are unfounded 
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:36): a left over fear from the past I'm guessing?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:36): Nate, YaReally recommended Sex God Method by Daniel Rose
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:36): and it's highly recommended by Kickass Academy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:36): "apply Sex God Method, Deep Spot shit, Squirting 101 shit, don’t like

going down on girls, aren’t into foreplay, are vanilla in the sack,

etc"
Nate (2013-10-29 12:37): @phil yeah it's left over from the past when I was less experienced.  
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:37): yah 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:37): have u had a girl you've been able to bang over 10 times.  That's a good way to gain that experience
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:37): sometimes I fear taking control pre coital 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 12:38): even if it'[s not a girl you want to bring home to Mom and Pop
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:38): I think my first gf I had sex with over 500 times
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:38): we literally would have sex a minimum 10 times a day
Nate (2013-10-29 12:38): my fear stems from being able to 'keep solid' so to speak, and less about getting to that point....
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:39): ahh I see
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:39): yeah that problem has been sneaking up on me too
Phillatio (2013-10-29 12:39): fucking annoying

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:19): as an Italian American i am deeply offended by that statement
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 13:23): @Pippy Long Sausage™ I want to be like I was 5 years ago when I did Crossfit for almost a year
Nate (2013-10-29 13:24): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Long As a Brooklyn American I say, toughen up
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:25): lol @ Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:25): @Xander.  Ah yeah, i'm not going to be that fitness guy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:26) (1x <3): but u mentioned wanting to gain mass I think. Cross fit may not get you close to that goal as would a program focused on heavier weights/compound lifts
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:26) (1x <3): i  have resources if mass is ur goal
Mark (2013-10-29 13:27): are you trying to sell us steroids?
Mark (2013-10-29 13:27) (1x <3): because i would like some
Nate (2013-10-29 13:27): He's an italian american, so that's his business

Nate (2013-10-29 13:34): Make dinner
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 13:35) (2x <3): Dive bar near her place or yours. Get her drunk. 
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 13:36): I think she lives in Alphabet City, if I recall correctly
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 13:36): Nuthin says "I'm not wining and dining your ass" quite like $3 pbr's

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 13:39): Last is a
website you ought to use to determine where your strength stands and how you
should get there.  The goal is for you to get to "Intermediate"
level strength in each of the four lifts. 


Strength Standards that is the link that determines your
Strength Standards. Enter your lifts as if you do 3 sets of 5 repetitions So
for bench, enter 5 reps at x lbs.

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:01): Check that place out Xander its 13th and Ave B.  It's a speakeasy thats pretty under the radar.  No signage just a burly bouncer outside.   They have a great mix of cocktails btw. 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:01): If u go, i'd scout it and confirm it's location beforehand because it takes a second to find.

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:11): Should I just be like, "Meet me at 13th and B"
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:11): Or should I say meet me at the place
Nate (2013-10-29 14:11): the first
Nate (2013-10-29 14:11) (1x <3): Remember girls get wetter the more venues you go to.  That's now 2 venues per se.
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:12): Where is all of my training going. I need to lose this girl
Nate (2013-10-29 14:12): Maybe you like her, it's not a crime
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:12) (1x <3): @Nate Yes it is
Mark (2013-10-29 14:13): sounds like someone has oneitis
Mark (2013-10-29 14:13) (2x <3): worse than aids
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:13): I navigated my way through a minefield of shit tests last time we hung out
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:14): She obviously likes me, but she has intimacy issues
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:14): Ain't nobody got time for that
Mark (2013-10-29 14:15): ugh

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:15): Srsly
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:18) (3x <3): I just texted a bunch of old numbers: 
"Happy national cat day.  It's your civic duty to go find a cat and pet the hell out of it"
Mark (2013-10-29 14:20) (1x <3): spam them with cat facts
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:21): Responses so far: "Really?!? Awwww 😻"   " Hahahaha so funny"   " Lol whos this."   " Haha really?"   " Haha interesting. My friend's cat scratches so I guess im not gonna pet it"
Nate (2013-10-29 14:21) (1x <3): ping texts ftw
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:24) (1x <3): To the one that mentioned her friends cat I said " Well U can stroke me instead, although I'm more of a lion than a cat"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:25): Jimmy i blushed reading that
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:26): How should i respond to the "Lol whos this." girl
Mark (2013-10-29 14:26): genghis khan
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:26): "the gingerbread man, don't remember??"

Mark (2013-10-29 14:31): ^

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:31) (2x <3): "I don't remember you either. We have so much in common!"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:32) (1x <3): "I ignore you: you ignore me. This is so 'us' "  I just modified it
Mark (2013-10-29 14:32): never call attention to something which doesn't aid your cause
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:32): That's my modified "I don't know you" in person answer
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:33): @Mark I agree, but whatevs
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:33): yeah true Mark but it works for some reason
Mark (2013-10-29 14:33): i usually say 'you need to stop drinking' or something like that
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:34): LOL @ DRE$
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:34): "I'm honestly a bit surprised"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:34): does this chat share PUA-related books and that stuff or is it te ghey in here

Nate (2013-10-29 14:36): haha
Mark (2013-10-29 14:37): Nate can tell it, i have no idea what she even looks like
Mark (2013-10-29 14:37): she doesn't exist for all i know
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:37): Nate's prob the best person to tell it
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:37): What stick and carrot scheme?
Nate (2013-10-29 14:37): Xander was accurate when he described her as 'plain'
Mark (2013-10-29 14:37): just a figment of our collective imaginations
Mark (2013-10-29 14:37): plain is too kind of a word
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:37): thats it
Mark (2013-10-29 14:37): more like 'piece of drywall'
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:37): two bros described her as plain.  Where is the controversy
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:38): So the way I remember it, is
Nate (2013-10-29 14:38): She kissed like a dead fish, and fucked like a doll
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:38): @Mark Just because your hedonic setpoint has adjusted to hotter women doesn't maker her not plain
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:38): Xander # closes some asian broad a while back
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): She texts him a bunch but he doesn't respond
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): Finally he donates her number here 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): Mark runs some good text game on her
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): Gets her to meet in person
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): And Nate is the one that actually shows up to the date
Mark (2013-10-29 14:39): she got stood up the first time
Mark (2013-10-29 14:39): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:39): Hahaha that's right
Nate (2013-10-29 14:40): yeah I didn't say anything, just didn't show up

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:41): incredible

"Hey:)"
"Heyy"
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 14:41) (1x <3): How many more permutations are there
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:41): I must be the king of picking up female orbiters
Nate (2013-10-29 14:41): She sent me another Hey a couple days ago
Mark (2013-10-29 14:41): she needs a lesson on pinging from us
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:42): She did launch into a really long story about the myths behind the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:43): Xander where did u number close this AFB
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:46): It was a pub in Hoboken
Nate (2013-10-29 14:46): Jersey, which explains everything...

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:48): So, my slumlord landlord decided to move out all of his furniture while I was gone, dumping all of my shit on the floor
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:48): When I went over there with Mark last night to move out my stuff, it looked like the police had conducted a raid on my room
Mark (2013-10-29 14:49): damn why haven't you moved out yet
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:50): Alright guys, so you provided the stick with that Kitty Sun story, here is the Carrot
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:50): @Mark I just did
Mark (2013-10-29 14:50): where to
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:51): back after The Game dropped, I think Tyler Durden spent some time re-defining himself and become a better person overall that focused on inner game
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:51): I'm living in Memphis Mark's living room
Nate (2013-10-29 14:51) (1x <3): I called in a tip on your place, my bad
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:51) (1x <3): @Nate "He's just too damn sexy! He's a loose cannon!"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:52): http://flirtisforum.ru/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=862
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:52) (1x <3): he wrote his book before he dropped The Blueprint Decoded.  It got leaked online before he could release it so he ceased his work.  Despite that, it's 76 pages of really solid shit.  Explains everything and I would mark it as top 3 PUA books i've read
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 14:52): That's a link to the PDF, it's called The Blueprint by Tyler Durden
Mark (2013-10-29 14:53): so any plans to move into the city?
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:53): Yes, but I'm fuckin broke
Mark (2013-10-29 14:53): Mark told me he's going to move into the city in like a month or so
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:53): We've been looking at places together
Mark (2013-10-29 14:54): i have a bedroom opening up in where i live in a month or two
Mark (2013-10-29 14:54): not sure what your budget is though
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:55): I'm not sure if I can manage anything about 1200/month
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:56): @Pippy Long Sausage™ That speakeasy you recommended looks cool, but I don't want to take her to a nice place
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:57): I want her to drink PBR + shot for $5
Nate (2013-10-29 14:57): Brooklyn
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:57): @Mark above
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:57): So then I can take an hour to commute to work in Jersey City...
Mark (2013-10-29 14:58): lol
Mark (2013-10-29 14:58): rock and a hard place
Mark (2013-10-29 14:58): after moving into the city, you can start interviewing more easily, so
Nate (2013-10-29 14:58): I think his hard place is the problem
Nate (2013-10-29 14:59): For 1200 you prob need to look at alphabet city
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 14:59): I'm just glad that I'm already mentally unhinged, otherwise I would be going insane
Mark (2013-10-29 15:00) (2x <3): well this is kind of like a support group
Mark (2013-10-29 15:00) (3x <3): for men
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:01): Fuck it, I'm taking her to some shitty dive bar
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:03) (2x <3): I'm tired of this classy shit. If she doesn't like it, TOO BAD
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 15:07): Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 15:08): u want shitty
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 15:08): Try The Horsebox on 14th and Ave A

Mark (2013-10-29 15:11): real busy
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:11): I'm definitely gonna bounce her to another place, too
Nate (2013-10-29 15:13) (1x <3): Go to the continental first and do shots
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 15:13): Hey guys, srs Q though.  What's a good way to respond to the "Who's this" text

Mark (2013-10-29 15:14): go there after keybar

Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:14): "secret admirer"  
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:14): idk 
Mark (2013-10-29 15:15): well, how did you two meet
Mark (2013-10-29 15:15): i'd start there to refresh her memory
Mark (2013-10-29 15:15): or something you 2 recently did together
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:15): So I guess Keybar it is
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:16): And then... bounce her to wherever I can remember in my drunken stupor
Nate (2013-10-29 15:20): Thompkin square park?
Nate (2013-10-29 15:21) (2x <3): Phil's Roof?
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:21): Nate what was ur ping text again

Marcus (2013-10-29 15:21): Yup
Nate (2013-10-29 15:21) (2x <3): "I'm working on my plot for world domination, and I may need your help"
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:22): Thx
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:22): damn that's cool

Mark (2013-10-29 15:24): haha
Mark (2013-10-29 15:25) (1x <3): she knows what's coming
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:25) (1x <3): @Mark I'm trying so hard not to burst out laughing right now
Mark (2013-10-29 15:26) (2x <3): you should've said 'meet me on the corner of rape alley and no one can hear your screams blvd'
Nate (2013-10-29 15:29) (1x <3): Sandeep wants to be the guy the manipulative girl is banging in the omega story.  He gets sadder every day.
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:29): I'm not even going to dignify her "skepticism" with a response
Nate (2013-10-29 15:30): good
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:30): nope
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:31): Why should she be skeptical
Nate (2013-10-29 15:31): Because you 'flaked' last time
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:31): Oh right, and I didn't apologize or grovel at her feet
Nate (2013-10-29 15:32): She can't win that so she's taking little jabs
Mark (2013-10-29 15:32) (4x <3): bitches love uncertainty
Nate (2013-10-29 15:32): I expect she'll throw a couple when you get there too
Mark (2013-10-29 15:33): this girl plays the game, i can tell
Mark (2013-10-29 15:33) (1x <3): that tingles my loins
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:33): Exactly
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:33): That's why I'm so interested
Mark (2013-10-29 15:34) (1x <3): you've met your match
Mark (2013-10-29 15:34) (1x <3): she's like Neo
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:34) (1x <3): yeah and you're agent smith
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:34) (1x <3): before you changed to your lame avatar
Mark (2013-10-29 15:34) (2x <3): you should replicate yourself and go airtight on her
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:35): Hahaha
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 15:35): wheenver i hear airtight on her i think of interracial dp
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:35) (1x <3): That avatar change is a feint. I'm getting in the mindset of a wolf in sheep's clothing
Nate (2013-10-29 15:35): http://www.rockymusic.org/img/priscilla/Priscilla-FlowerWigL.png
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:36) (1x <3): dude that ping text is fucking dope @Nate
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:37): I think it's also because I've been late to both dates that we've had
Nate (2013-10-29 15:37): Thanks
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:38): response in 4 minutes
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:38) (2x <3): = set up a date and bring a condom
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:38) (1x <3): Just sent it to 5 girl no reply yet
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 15:38): Phil u have a funny comedic sense man
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:38): Girls
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:39): thanks! @Pippy Long Sausage™
Mark (2013-10-29 15:39): Phil actually reads books, can you believe that
Mark (2013-10-29 15:39) (2x <3): what a loser
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:39) (1x <3): Damnit Phillatio, you're stealing my niche
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:39): lol 
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:39): I'm buying some piano wire tonight
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:39) (1x <3): I can let you borrow some
Nate (2013-10-29 15:40): @phil who did you send to that gave you a date in 4 mins?
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:40): good ol' portia
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:40): Thanks, I just bought a large wheel of asiago
Nate (2013-10-29 15:40): ahh
Mark (2013-10-29 15:40): can't believe you haven't met up with her yet
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:40): I know lol I've been stringing shit along for forever
Nate (2013-10-29 15:40) (1x <3): I thought she was doing the stringing?
Phillatio (2013-10-29 15:41): yeaaaaa 
Nate (2013-10-29 15:42): Nothing says payback like making her choke on your dick
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:42): It's time to bust out the Butt Poke Special
Nate (2013-10-29 15:44): Lidiane annoys me.  Unless I ask direct questions she never replies to anything I text her.
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:46) (1x <3): "Do you want to die tonight?"
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:46): Oh shit, that's not right
Nate (2013-10-29 15:46): Like literally I'll say "Let's hang out Thursday" and she won't reply, so then I'll text "Are you free to hang out on Thursday?" and she'll answer
Mark (2013-10-29 15:47): never ask questions Xander, just assume it to be so
Mark (2013-10-29 15:47): but yeah, fuck girls who play games through text 
Nate (2013-10-29 15:48) (1x <3): She was super receptive to anything I did in person, and cold as fuck in text
Nate (2013-10-29 15:49): I got annoyed last night with it and started sending sexual texts
Nate (2013-10-29 15:50): She actually started replying for about 10 minutes straight, then said "Have to go to bed, Good Night" and signed off
Mark (2013-10-29 15:51) (1x <3): i've learned to set up all future dates while i'm still on the previous date
Mark (2013-10-29 15:51) (1x <3): the one time i make vague plans, i get dicked
Mark (2013-10-29 15:51) (1x <3): because her emotions might be running high while on the actual date, but a few days later when she gets the text, she might be somewhere else entirely, emotionally
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:52): @Nate Signed off? Aol Instant Messenger? lol
Nate (2013-10-29 15:52): Whatsapp
Nate (2013-10-29 15:52) (1x <3): Well she agreed to get together with me without me having to say at all what we're doing, and I implied I wanted to see her to bang her, so...
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:54): Ugh. I'm going to unleash full cocky Xander mode tonight
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:54): One way or another, this thing is coming to a close
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:54): Xander where does she live
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:55): I believe in Alphabet City
Nate (2013-10-29 15:57) (1x <3): I'm surprised you didn't ever walk her home
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:57): I almost did the first night. Second time we were at Flatiron Room
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:58): I'm so good at this game until I actually start liking a girl
Marcus (2013-10-29 15:58): Instead of be cocky. You should take her to a ok bar. Then take her on a walk, let her show u her place. If she doesn't then unleash the...
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:58): It's rare for that to happen
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 15:58): Me liking a girl

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:01): Yup
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:01): "hahahah what kind of help do you need? Soprry I haven't texted you in a while, I was working and then I went home to t for like 4 days." 
"I can't say over the phone. Nowhere is safe."

Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:05): Xander
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:06): Would you say you've transformed since you started pickup?
Mark (2013-10-29 16:07) (4x <3): had my biggest trading day of the year today, champagne for everyone wooo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:08): http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfxoh6XgCm1qdwjb5o1_500.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:08): Mark what kind of product do u sling

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:10): ^ Closers waiting for Xanders answer to Jimmy
Mark (2013-10-29 16:10): haha i know nothing about individual stocks
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:11): @Jimmyayo Yes, definitely
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:12): fuck that she says: 
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:12): "I can hang between classes, 10:30am-6pm"
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:12): yeah like that's gonna work
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:13): I wanna ask about another night
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:14): Xander Xone
@Jimmyayo Yes, definitely
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:14): how so?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:14): But
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:14) (2x <3): http://i.imgur.com/Jb6QEdk.png
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:15): You're almost there brochacho!
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:15): I feel as if I'm fast approaching the point of extreme diminishing returns
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:15): 6s and occasional 7s will approach me
Nate (2013-10-29 16:15) (1x <3): Xander used to be a five foot tall black man, then he started pickup and changed himself
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:16): Because of my inherent value
Mark (2013-10-29 16:16) (3x <3): now he's a 7 foot tall black man
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:16): But I'm not quite cracking the highest tiers of poosy that I would like to
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:17): yes
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:17): And my career is a fucking joke
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:17): I turn 27 on December 3rd
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:17): eventually you'll get to a point where u wont sleep with a 6 unless someone puts a gun to ur head. and that same difference steeps into ur interactions
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:17): *seeps
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:17): go fix it
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:17): I'm pretty much already at that point
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:17): @Xander Xone
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:18): I don't feel that I'm overvaluing myself, though
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:18): yeah ur about to enter what could be a potentially frustrating stage
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:18): 6s dont do it, 7s require better game/moar effort
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:18): 8s and 9s ya obviously
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:20): Dana is an 8 to me, but I'm not sure any of you would agree
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:20) (1x <3): f it makes you guys feel any better, eeeeeevery PUA goes through this stage. And it’s exactly as frustrating as it feels lol…you pass that threshold where banging <6 just isn't an option anymore, like you couldn't force yourself to do it even with a gun to your head.

But you're still chickenshit to go after the top girls AND there aren't as many 8+ chicks out there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:20): AND they're surrounded by more obstacles etc. so it's like "fuck, this 
feels harder and I've burned the boats on sailing back to the easy shit"
 lol
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:20): It's like something genetic
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:20): I think she's an 8
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:20): Her pheromones are attracting me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:20) (2x <3): Your only option is to wallow in frustration and misery, or sack up and tell yourself you won't leave the bar without approaching the 3 hottest girls there even if they shoot you down or the logistics are terrible.
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:21): but in a different way
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:21) (1x <3): http://lumpy.webfactional.com/2013/7/#comment-heartiste-456756
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:21): I think we have complementary major histocompatability complexes
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:22) (1x <3): @Phillatio She's not like hot in the dumb bimbo fashion
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:23) (1x <3): I've certainly been having a blast 95% of the time that I've been going out
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:23): Regardless of how the night goes pickup-wise
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:25) (1x <3): I mean most nights I'll make out with at least one chick 
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:25) (1x <3): and get 2-3 numbers
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:26): @Phillatio Same here
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:26): and I'm happy with that
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:26): I don't really give a shit if I bring a girl home 
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:26) (1x <3): I have you guys to thank for having such a blast, btw
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:26): I mean whatever 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:29): Hey guys, realtalk for a sec
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:29) (1x <3): When are we doing the Closers meetup?

Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:50): I'm a little miffed that I missed the last Closers Meetup as well as GAYLIFE MEETUP
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:51): you should be miffed
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:54) (1x <3): I ain't missing the next Closers Meetup, even if it means not getting paid or getting laid

Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 16:57): Yo she said she can hang between 10:30-6pm
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:57): I shouldn't have asked about tonight
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:57): yeah when I'm working
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:58): Lunch? I thought that was your favorite, Phil
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:58): I don't want to get lunch with her
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:58): she's not worth lunch to me
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 16:59) (1x <3): @Phillatio She's too busy getting plowed by some other dude tonight!
Phillatio (2013-10-29 16:59) (1x <3): well w/e there's no point in living anymore
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 16:59): Phil: Say this

Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 17:00): @Mark not sure, but sounds like it'll be fun
Jimmyayo (2013-10-29 17:01): And tickets are cheap
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:02): @Phillatio Seems a little... premature to be doing that
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:02): Especially if you actually enjoyed her company
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:02): @Jimmyayo How cheap is cheap
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:03): fuck.. well what's my options here
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:04): because yeah I do like her
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:07): Hope Mr. Ltd does better than making out with an uggo again tonight...

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:19): I smell a wiff of vulnerability

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:19): Xander didnt u post that this moarning
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:19): shiet let me check
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:19): Nope
Marcus (2013-10-29 17:19): I may hit 13 step tn, anybody down to join
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:20): okay I might send that @Nate thanks
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:20): but prob later today
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:20): @Pippy Long Sausage™ You're thinking of this one: http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/study-dominance-not-looks-predicts-mens-mating-success/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:20): ah yes thanks
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:20): Yeah Phillatio, you need to learn when it's appropriate to sprinkle in da beta
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:20) (1x <3): I don't know how to be beta
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:21) (1x <3): I'm just kidding
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:21) (1x <3): lol
Nate (2013-10-29 17:21): Well especially if the alternative is throwing away the number
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:21): lol, I know
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:21) (1x <3): Being beta is fine, nay... NECESSARY... but it's context-dependent
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:22): It's only fine when you're doing it at the right times
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:25) (2x <3): "I give up, what nights are you free. I'm not around during the day and I'm through guessing."
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:25) (1x <3): slight variation
Nate (2013-10-29 17:26) (4x <3): Ugh, I'm ready to leave gaylife too if I hear 'nofap' one more time
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:27): seriously I think that is going too far
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:27): I mean nofap
Nate (2013-10-29 17:28) (1x <3): nofap = I'm desperate and grasping at straws
TiMex (2013-10-29 17:28): Yea not necessary or helpful IMO
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:28): Nofap is fine... if you're releasing once a week
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:29): So that you're not going insane and fucking up your testosterone levels
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:29) (1x <3): I'm kind of inadvertently on NotMuchFap, though it wasn't a conscious decision
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:29): if you're deriving most of ur bust from por.n, i reckon that screws up your dopamine levels
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:30): I haven't really watched porn in like... half a year
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 17:30): Maybe that's why I'm so amped-up to ravage hunnies in real life
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-29 17:30) (1x <3): that memory spank bank has been built up, eh

Nate (2013-10-29 17:47): That tinder match is like a 9ish for me
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:48): yeah she's pretty up there
Phillatio (2013-10-29 17:48): hard to tell through pics
Nate (2013-10-29 17:49) (1x <3): if she had bigger tits she'd be close to a 10 for me
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:04): @Nate You're a big lips and big tits man, as I recall
Nate (2013-10-29 18:05): I might be *
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:12): Man, this groupme interface is awful. There's no way I'm scrolling back to 8 or 9 days ago when you made that comment
Nate (2013-10-29 18:13): Lol yeah

Phillatio (2013-10-29 18:28): seriously she can't look outside 
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:28): The shit tests just keep on rolling in
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:29): I kinda want to send "You don't like uncertainty, do you"
Nate (2013-10-29 18:31) (1x <3): Just send her "It will be a surprise"
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:31): Nah, she needs a little counter jab
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:32): None of this magical adventure bullshit!
Nate (2013-10-29 18:32) (2x <3): "The only ribbons will be used to tie you down"
Xander Xone (2013-10-29 18:32): It's not really calibrated to the situation
Nate (2013-10-29 18:33) (2x <3): I'm trolling

Nate (2013-10-29 21:52): okay I'll do the fit test tomorrow
Marcus (2013-10-29 21:54): I will post my numbers, a shamed of my push up jacks today, it was where I was about to vomit bc I haven't worked out heavy in 2 months.

Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 09:45): He wants to respect her and make her feel special?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 09:47) (1x <3): Man i'm so tempted to go see pretty lights

Marcus (2013-10-30 10:03): They will perform with a live band
Marcus (2013-10-30 10:03): This is going to be interesting
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:07): Better than sex?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:08): http://wantickets.com/Events/136178/
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:08): Oh man I can't believe I didn't buy tix to this thing...

Marcus (2013-10-30 10:09): Yeah its two days Nov 1th and 2nd
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:09): Damn it, walked her home but was unable to weasel my way inside
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:09) (1x <3): Gheyyyyyy
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:10): I have been... demoted
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:10): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:11): good morning everyone
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:11) (2x <3): what a wonderful day!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:12): Jesus, I drank a decent amount last night. Frozen margaritas
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:13) (1x <3): Isn't it so amazing to be alive!? Say "yes" to life!
Marcus (2013-10-30 10:13): Lots of tickets all over for that event
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:24): kleft gay life
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:25): I'm so done
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:28) (1x <3): Can't believe GOL is the new mod 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:29) (1x <3): The only person that seems to like him is MTB
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:29): Who hangs on GOL's every word
Mark (2013-10-30 10:30): to be fair, GOL has consistent text game, although he has a holier than thou attitude sometimes
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:30): I'm not saying he doesn't know game
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:30) (1x <3): I'm just saying he's a dick head
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:30) (3x <3): Yeah, he's got game.  But being a mod isn't about that
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:31): right ^
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:31): oh 1pm @Mark I don't feel like texting
Mark (2013-10-30 10:31): yeah he is likely to go on a power trip a la that other dude
Mark (2013-10-30 10:31): k 1's good
Mark (2013-10-30 10:31): btw we're having lunch at 1... ya'll are welcome to join
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:32) (2x <3): I see a potential conflict of interest, since he's also doing coaching sessions
Mark (2013-10-30 10:32): funny what a little bit of power does to a man
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:32): oh chyea
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:32): to a *little* man
Mark (2013-10-30 10:33): i saw the same thing with liquid at the meetup
Mark (2013-10-30 10:33): he was so serious about it lmao
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:33): I kno lol it was pretty amusing to me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:33): Oh gawwwwwd
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:33): You guys have no idea about liquid...
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:33): he was trying to out alpha me
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:33): didn't work
Mark (2013-10-30 10:34): he's got like napoleon complex or something
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:34): We used to rag on him so much because of his sad over-inflated ego
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:34): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:34): One of his famous lines to girls was "I'm the best looking out of my friends"
Mark (2013-10-30 10:34): hahaha
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:34): oh I've said that
Mark (2013-10-30 10:34): but at least it's plausible with you Phil
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:34): haha
Mark (2013-10-30 10:35): unless this dude has some trollish looking friends
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:35): yea he's a really tiny dude too
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:35): like 5'6" or something
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:35): He's just not someone easy to like/respect 
Mark (2013-10-30 10:36) (1x <3): i don't mind a short dude who's confident of himself, but this guy wears his insecurities on his sleeve
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:36): Right 
Mark (2013-10-30 10:36): you're like the only normal mod
Mark (2013-10-30 10:36): unless there are others i don't know about
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:37): I'm not a mod
Mark (2013-10-30 10:37): o
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:37): not anymore
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:37): I quit a while back because I couldn't stand Liquid and Sleiveen
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:37): Along w/ lots of other members lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:38) (1x <3): Guys were so value-leeching back then
Mark (2013-10-30 10:38): ugh
Mark (2013-10-30 10:39): i guess that's why they say the overwhelming majority of pickup community members aren't getting laid
Mark (2013-10-30 10:39): due to adverse selection: they joined pickup because of some social defect(s)
Mark (2013-10-30 10:40): you can translate that to interpersonal skill in general i suppose
Mark (2013-10-30 10:40): inability to play nice with others
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:40): mmm 
Mark (2013-10-30 10:40): well that's why we have this separate room... too much noise in that other one
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:41): Well, Well, well.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:41): GothamLife is certainly headed in a dark direction.
Mark (2013-10-30 10:42): did you bag the elusive one last night
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:42): From what I've seen, these "splinter" groups form usually out of spite for the main group
Mark (2013-10-30 10:42): what was her name, Dan something?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:43): @Mark Nope. I was barricaded at the gates to her abode.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:43): Did u try to use her bathroom at least?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:43): Yes.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:44): oh jeeze
Mark (2013-10-30 10:45): did you feel her up at keybar?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:46): KEYBAR
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:47): I have 6 or 7 free drink tickets for that place
Mark (2013-10-30 10:47): me want
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:47): some how I'm getting emails from VaperizerUSA
Phillatio (2013-10-30 10:47): the internet knows me too well
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:48): I went ages ago and never was able to go back to use them.  I'll give u a cpl 
Mark (2013-10-30 10:48) (1x <3): maybe because you keep on googling 'kush og 420 trees4lif'
Mark (2013-10-30 10:49): i like keybar, although i've met my fair share of nyu feminist bush hogs there
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 10:50) (2x <3): @Mark I didn't take her to Keybar. We started at HorseBox and then bounced to some place with delicious frozen margaritas and happy hour after midnight
Mark (2013-10-30 10:50): word
Mark (2013-10-30 10:53) (2x <3): this girl's a tough nut to crack
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 10:53) (1x <3): How was the date itself xandy? Good kino?  Makeout?
Nate (2013-10-30 10:58) (1x <3): Number closed a blonde paralegal about 38 I guess on the way to work.  Unbelievably hot.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:01): @Mark It was like a protracted sparring match
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:02): I was able to go somewhat Darth Vader last night and put her on the defensive
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:03): Errr, @Jimmyayo
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:06): I don't have a good feeling about where things are headed. She's holding on to her frame with white knuckles. I'm going to employ slightly different tactics
Mark (2013-10-30 11:09): hang in there bud
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:10) (2x <3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7PAYhmoKkA
Mark (2013-10-30 11:10) (4x <3): it'll all be worth it once you dismantle her chastity belt and show her your lightsaber
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:11): I can only imagine how knee-deep in shit I'll be once I do break through
Nate (2013-10-30 11:11) (1x <3): @Xander later today I need to sacrifice a gaylifer to call up to the Dark Jesus for help with texting.  I found a girl I actually like so far and don't want to mess it up before I get a date
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:13): @Nate Haha
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:14): 
Mark
ugh
i guess that's why they say the overwhelming majority of pickup community members aren't getting laid
due to adverse selection: they joined pickup because of some social defect(s)
you can translate that to interpersonal skill in general i suppose
inability to play nice with others
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:14): Probably most insightful comment thus far.  The guys that are typically drawn to pickup are the ones who need it the least
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:14): the guys who would benefit the most (unconsciously competent naturals) usually want nothing to do with it
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:14): Because there's no helping them
Mark (2013-10-30 11:14) (1x <3): lmao Xander i want one of those fat suits for Christmas
Mark (2013-10-30 11:14): and just fall over and over again on the street
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:15): @Mark I want to be a perverted Santa
Mark (2013-10-30 11:15): so you want to be Santa eh?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:15): Come sit on Santa's lap
Nate (2013-10-30 11:15): @Pippy Long Sausage™ I disagree.  I'd say the guys drawn to pickup are frequently the ones who need to learn social skills the most
Mark (2013-10-30 11:16): i think Pippy meant 'most'
Nate (2013-10-30 11:16): Then that makes sense
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:16) (1x <3): They're just trying to find the One!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:16): Yeah Nate thanks
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:16): Cut them some slack. What's your problem, you don't believe in True Love?
Nate (2013-10-30 11:16): then they find out Keanu Reeves is already married
Mark (2013-10-30 11:17) (1x <3): vagina? check. heartbeat? check. yup, she's the one
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:17): i think PUA can help a guy out fo' sho but in cases like Rahat/Liquid it ends up enforcing negative behavior until they finally see the light and find out what to fix
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:17) (1x <3): Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet; you are a plague and we are the cure.
Nate (2013-10-30 11:18): Yeah I had the one syndrome, and I suppose in my deep down balls I still do.  I changed priorities a bit tho.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:18) (1x <3): those simple pick up guys are freakin hilarious 
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:18): That's the thing... I want to believe that there's something special about this Dana girl, but my extreme cynicism is preventing that
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:19): So I think that when I cam inside ellen I infected her with the phil virus 
Mark (2013-10-30 11:19) (1x <3): she's making you invest
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:19): I done seen too much shiiiiiiit in this world. It's a vale of tears.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:19) (2x <3): she's somewhat obsessed 
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:20): @Mark Yeah, fuck her girl game. Fuck it hard
Mark (2013-10-30 11:21): guys
Mark (2013-10-30 11:21) (1x <3): let's do one of these https://www.joingrouper.com/
Mark (2013-10-30 11:21): they're fun
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:21): I'm game.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:22): oh I've heard of that
Nate (2013-10-30 11:22): I'd try it
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:22): Sign me up
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:24): I'm out. Need to do actual work. @Nate, him me up with what you need
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:24): Later
Nate (2013-10-30 11:24): yeah she just replied to my text this morning, so there isn't any rush
Nate (2013-10-30 11:29): btw can't come to lunch today, have a meeting at 2
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 11:30) (1x <3): No lunch for me either, gonna hit gym
Mark (2013-10-30 11:33): why are you 2 being so responsible
Mark (2013-10-30 11:33): wtf
Mark (2013-10-30 11:33): thought we had a pact
Nate (2013-10-30 11:34): Hey I suggested yesterday and noone jumped
Mark (2013-10-30 11:37): still waiting for sushi buffet btw
Mark (2013-10-30 11:37): soon
Nate (2013-10-30 11:37): ichi umi
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:39): This picture is kinda NSFW because of LANGUAGE:
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:39): I had to return for a moment because I saw contro post this on his facebook: http://i.imgur.com/DlT7qjG.jpg
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:41): That's one of my fave quotes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:41): also "I used to fuc.k guys like you in prison" ....so raw
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:41): wow
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:41): I'm totally going to say that
Nate (2013-10-30 11:41): Btw for those going to the show tonight, did they get mezzanine tickets?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:42): Btw, before I leave, when is the Closers meetup?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:42) (2x <3): Say it, kiss the the AMOG on the lips and then punch him square in the face
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:42): Nate get General Admin bro
Nate (2013-10-30 11:42): Why?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:42): but guys beware. I've seen Pretty Lights 3 times or so and he always used his electronic/dj setup
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:42): I've heard less than stellar feedback from his live show as my friends went a couple months back.  But then again, they were b
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:43): *biased
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:43): it may not be the same electronic hardcore stuff u see him throwdown with
Nate (2013-10-30 11:43): his music videos on youtube are not what I'd call hardcore
Mark (2013-10-30 11:43) (1x <3): wait, we're having a closers meetup?
Mark (2013-10-30 11:44) (2x <3): Nate, ichi umi actually looks legit... o snap im drooling
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:45): @Mark Yes, we are. I'm calling it.
Nate (2013-10-30 11:45): @Mark it's good
Mark (2013-10-30 11:45) (1x <3): well, let me know if you're going or not Xander, i'll make sure to not show up
Mark (2013-10-30 11:45) (1x <3): to keep up with tradition
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:46): oh you 
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:46): @Mark Meet me at 13th and A
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:46) (1x <3): http://i.imgur.com/Tr02vTw.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 11:47) (1x <3): Nate, i'd compare tonight to Nirvana Unplugged whereas he typically does more stuff similar to Nirvana's Nevermind
Mark (2013-10-30 11:48): Xander i know 13th and A is actually code for chloroform and roofies
Nate (2013-10-30 11:48): I'd much rather see a regular show
Mark (2013-10-30 11:48) (2x <3): but i'll come anyways
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:52): @Mark Oh, you'll cum alright
Mark (2013-10-30 11:53): i'll come whenever i please
Mark (2013-10-30 11:53): you, on the other hand, need my permission
Phillatio (2013-10-30 11:54): HOT
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:56): Aw, come on! I don't need shit from you too, Mark!
Mark (2013-10-30 11:57) (1x <3): Mark 1, Xander 0
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:57): That's it, I'm going Galt from the gay dating scene
Nate (2013-10-30 11:58): Xander's about to get rapey
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 11:58) (1x <3): "About" to?
Marcus (2013-10-30 11:58): @nate got dates tn?
Marcus (2013-10-30 11:58): My date just flaked
Nate (2013-10-30 11:58): Maybe
Nate (2013-10-30 11:59): It's flake week in Closers!
Marcus (2013-10-30 11:59): Sent 'gay' text
Nate (2013-10-30 12:00): legit reason or 'I don't feel up to it' bullshit?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:00): You're right, I have been flaking on girls left and right lately
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:02): its never a legit reason
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:02): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8ed6877023aa013170350a2ea3158b5e
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:02) (1x <3): if a girl flakes I just assume she's fucking another guy
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:02): They r both legit
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:02): I fucked up with the Thursday, but then called and setup the date
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:02): seems reasonable 
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:03): I like the 'gay' text
Nate (2013-10-30 12:03): The second isn't legit if you consider respect legit.  Who forgets something like that?
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:03): I can't say 'gay'
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:03): its against my nature
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:04): but I'll say lame.com
Nate (2013-10-30 12:04): yeah I won't say gay, but I'll say lame
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:05): Whatever it already done
Nate (2013-10-30 12:05): ya
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:05): U agree lame. Com would have been better
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:05): @Nate What's a matter? You have something against being happy?
Nate (2013-10-30 12:05): I do, no one gets to be happy but me
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:06) (1x <3): nah gay is good too it's just not for me
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:06) (2x <3): @Nate Ah, textbook solipsism.
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:06): Whatever I guess u have time to workout then
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:06): @Phillatio I was under the impression that you were all about gay
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:06): *I
Mark (2013-10-30 12:07): you would know Xander, you slept in his bed
Mark (2013-10-30 12:07) (2x <3): Phil has been telling me about these 'sleepovers' you've been having
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:07) (1x <3): shhh he wasn't awake for that @Mark
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:08): @Mark It was his couch! At least that's where I remember falling asleep...
Nate (2013-10-30 12:08) (1x <3): @Xander someone loves philosophy
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:09) (1x <3): @Nate I only had to engage in about 2 hours of philosophical argument last night
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:10): @Mark Jesus H. Christ, I AM invested
Mark (2013-10-30 12:12) (1x <3): she's a pro, i like her
Mark (2013-10-30 12:12) (1x <3): your diagnosis is onegina
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:14): She basically got me to reveal my fucking metaphysical quest
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:16): What is the ape to man? A laughing stock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the ubermensch: a laughing stock or a painful embarrassment.
Mark (2013-10-30 12:18) (2x <3): so she would be an uberwensch
Mark (2013-10-30 12:18): am i interpreting that correctly
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:19): nietzsche
Nate (2013-10-30 12:20) (3x <3): This girl is basically Xander with a vagina, no wonder he likes her
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:20): She liked when I referred to our hanging out, drinking frozen margaritas as a "Dionysian revel"
Nate (2013-10-30 12:22): The goddess of wine, ecstasy, and ritual madness
Nate (2013-10-30 12:22): sounds about right
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:25): Xander when is the wedding
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:25): It seems u r n love
Mark (2013-10-30 12:27): why does everyone want to fuck themselves
Mark (2013-10-30 12:27) (1x <3): stop stealing my thing
Nate (2013-10-30 12:27) (1x <3): Who better to know what I like
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:27): @Mark Because I don't know anyone else who comes close
Mark (2013-10-30 12:29): do you know someone who comes far?
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:30): ah hem 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:30) (2x <3): ::clears throat loudly
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:31): I have always fancied myself a bastion of reason, but it seems that I have fallen from those lofty Apollonian heights
Nate (2013-10-30 12:31): someone is also a fan of greek and roman gods
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:33): I'm lost in the wilderness of the soul without a compass
Nate (2013-10-30 12:34): God is my guide, and tormentor
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:36): I'm wondering if I should text her today. I don't know what to do with girls I actually like
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:37): The Game never taught me that
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:38): I'm reverting to beta status at an alarming rate
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:38): Xander hold ur ground
Mark (2013-10-30 12:38) (1x <3): beta alert, beta alert
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:38): Dont text for a week
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:38): Let her text u
Nate (2013-10-30 12:39) (2x <3): Well I dunno if that's a good idea either
Mark (2013-10-30 12:39) (1x <3): contaminated substance must be quarantined according to section 8.1 in the guidelines
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:40): Guys I have some bad news "Xander is hooked"
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:41): A great loss for the PUA community
Mark (2013-10-30 12:41): fuck it, more for us
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:41): @Marcus That's simply terrible advice
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:41) (1x <3): Thx
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:41) (3x <3): he has a knack for that
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:41): Haha
Mark (2013-10-30 12:42) (4x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/14a732f023b00131c1102251565bbad1
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:42) (3x <3): She's not going to text me. She's going to wait indefinitely for me to text her
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:43) (3x <3): text game recognized @Mark
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:43): @Xander Xone I'm guessing that too
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:44) (2x <3): She knows that I know how the game is played. She also knows that I know that she knows.
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:44): @xander wait a week, if she doesn't text her
Nate (2013-10-30 12:45) (2x <3): @Marcus you're assuming he wants to wait a week to see her again
Marcus (2013-10-30 12:45): Yeah I guess I am
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:45): I'm not good at taking things slow
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:45): its actually a problem
Nate (2013-10-30 12:46) (4x <3): grr I hate when I text a girl and she responds really fast, and then I ask her out and then doesn't respond fast to that one text...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:46): I mean, the fact that she continued to see me after showing up to our first date with huge, unconcealed hickeys, and coming to the first two dates at least half an hour late
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:46): And "flaking" on her on Sunday
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:46): yes @Nate that pisses me off too
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:46): cause its so obvious what the fuck is going on 
Nate (2013-10-30 12:46): yeah
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:47) (2x <3): yeah seriously @Xander Xone she may be more hooked than you might think
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:47): but obviously still playing some stupid girl game
Nate (2013-10-30 12:48): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/fcc4978023b001310b241eec51a0be4e
Nate (2013-10-30 12:48): Notice the name, lol
Mark (2013-10-30 12:48) (3x <3): that's the problem with sending player vibes Xander, it ups their bitch shields to max power
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:49): @Nate Haha! Hilarious name. Also, channeling some Xone, I see
Nate (2013-10-30 12:50): yeah possibly a bit
Nate (2013-10-30 12:50): This isn't the girl I was talking about earlier tho
Nate (2013-10-30 12:50): This one is just a fun diversion
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:50) (1x <3): A mere plaything
Nate (2013-10-30 12:51): indeed
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:51) (1x <3): A child's bauble
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:51) (1x <3): A shiny trinket to be used and then discarded
Nate (2013-10-30 12:52): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/893475a023b101310b241eec51a0be4e
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:52): getting some asian pooon 
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:52) (3x <3): @Nate Is she open 24/7, too?
Nate (2013-10-30 12:52): I think she's half asian half black
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:53): exotic
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:53): Yeah, definitely has black hair, I was about to say
Nate (2013-10-30 12:53): @Xander I hope so
Mark (2013-10-30 12:53): Phil
Mark (2013-10-30 12:53): my body is ready
Mark (2013-10-30 12:53): for lunch
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:53): fuck time flies 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:53): flys*
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:53): I haven't done any work
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:54): @Phillatio I have pretty much only done some data entry today
Nate (2013-10-30 12:54): bitch still hasn't replied tho, irritating because I wanna find out if I have a date tonight or not
Mark (2013-10-30 12:54) (2x <3): ok, no lunch then, just a smoke break
Mark (2013-10-30 12:54) (1x <3): i'm a bit tied up too
Mark (2013-10-30 12:54) (2x <3): in this chat
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:54): oh hell yea
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:54): okay 20 minutes
Mark (2013-10-30 12:54): k
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:55): singing off for now sayonara
Phillatio (2013-10-30 12:55): bois 
Nate (2013-10-30 12:55): I had a large late breakfast.  No way I'm eating now.
Mark (2013-10-30 12:55): what about vagina
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 12:57): Watching GothamLife slowly die is both tragic and amusing. It's like a tragicomedy
Nate (2013-10-30 12:58): I've been severely lacking vagina this week.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:00): Vagina is so easy to come by. What about some kind of meaningful connection?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:00) (1x <3): Nigh impossible
Mark (2013-10-30 13:01) (1x <3): fuck Xander, what's with all this beta shit
Mark (2013-10-30 13:01): you've changed
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:01): When I say vagina is easy to come by, it's not sour grapes
Nate (2013-10-30 13:01) (4x <3): Fuck meaningful connection right now, I want vagina
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:01): Unlike 90% of gaylife
Nate (2013-10-30 13:02): Tomorrow barring more flakiness, I'm seeing lidiane.  That should give me some pussy.
Mark (2013-10-30 13:02) (1x <3): meaningful connection + smoking body = win
Mark (2013-10-30 13:02): i'm just busting your balls Xander, i mostly agree with you
Nate (2013-10-30 13:03): I don't think I'm good enough with women to be able to find a meaningful connection...
Nate (2013-10-30 13:03): yet
Phillatio (2013-10-30 13:04): I don't think I'l get there until I'm ready anyway
Nate (2013-10-30 13:04): same
Nate (2013-10-30 13:04): For now I'll just focus on having fun
Nate (2013-10-30 13:06) (2x <3): If this bitch will reply back...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:33) (1x <3): @Nate Time to smash Lidocaine
Nate (2013-10-30 13:34) (1x <3): I've already smashed her, this is for a resmash
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:34): Queue up the re-smash
Nate (2013-10-30 13:35): She's one of my 'I want sex this week' girls
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:38): I can't get me enough of those GothamLife texts!
Nate (2013-10-30 13:40): Unless GOL is posting it, I consider any text like I consider internet advertising.  Don't look at it or it will annoy you and make you worse off.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:41) (2x <3): I would analyze Mr. Ltd's text for him, but he wouldn't listen to my advice anyway
Nate (2013-10-30 13:41): Speaking of analyzing.  Might as well deal with that chick now.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:42): Which chick?
Nate (2013-10-30 13:42) (1x <3): I met her on my way to work.  She was going to her first day of work.
Nate (2013-10-30 13:42): The one I wanted your dark powers with
Nate (2013-10-30 13:42): I asked her out this week, but she said she didn't know her schedule yet so she probably couldn't this week.
Nate (2013-10-30 13:43): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ad8e661023b801310b241eec51a0be4e
Nate (2013-10-30 13:43): This is what I've sent her so far
Nate (2013-10-30 13:43): I want to get to a date
Nate (2013-10-30 13:44): I'm looking for Xander level advice.  She was my type definitely
Nate (2013-10-30 13:44): Well from the 10 mins of conversation we had at least
Nate (2013-10-30 13:45): I thought about asking her out for Sunday, but I'm not sure the best way to get there
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:45): Alright, I'm heading to the john to ponder
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:46): Taking my phone with me
Nate (2013-10-30 13:46): I may have a meeting in 15 mins I forgot about, so I may be slow in responding
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 13:49): I'm gonna warm up by answering Mr. Ltd's text, even though it's likely in vain
Nate (2013-10-30 13:53): haha
Nate (2013-10-30 13:53) (1x <3): my meeting was cancelled *cheers*
Nate (2013-10-30 13:56): Bah, Wawa texted me and said she can't commit to anything tonight because she has to work late.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:02): Alright, I'm done with Ltd for now
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:02): I doubt most people in the chat are even going to understand what I'm saying
Nate (2013-10-30 14:04): I understand, although I still make those mistakes..
Nate (2013-10-30 14:05): Sent to Carla, my Haitian girl "Lets hang out this weekend, possibly Sat afternoon".  Her response: "Ok"
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:09): Just as I thought, Mr. Ltd is going to completely ignore my advice
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:10): The liquid
So word is you are the pro texter in this group!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:10): The liquid just PMed me
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:10): I wonder where this is going
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:10): Perhaps an aggressive confrontation!
Nate (2013-10-30 14:10): or he finally realized he needs help
Nate (2013-10-30 14:11): Sandeep's icon is so appropriate to his evolving attitude.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 14:12): oh dude
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 14:12): please share
Nate (2013-10-30 14:13): Sandeep: i fuckin hate green lights - i'm still not confident that they're real.

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 14:15): lol got it thanks man
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:16) (1x <3): https://i.groupme.com/4c8b7ba01d500131d4340e9f62d38f66
Nate (2013-10-30 14:16): Unfortunately in his case his icon isn't ironic
Nate (2013-10-30 14:18): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/93997eb023bd0131ff0236387bfbb521
TiMex (2013-10-30 14:18): I think it's like a teddy bear peeking out
Nate (2013-10-30 14:18): I don't know why I posted that, just felt like it
Nate (2013-10-30 14:21) (1x <3): @Xander ltd not only didn't listen to you, he compounded the very problem you described
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 14:21): jeebus
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 14:21) (2x <3): is that a bear with cum on its head
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:22): Cum all over
Nate (2013-10-30 14:23) (2x <3): That bear looks so pathetic it reminds me of an abused child hiding from his abuser.  I feel sad for Sandeep just looking at it
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:24): HAHAHA!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:24): Stop making me laugh at work, guuuuuuyzzzz!
Nate (2013-10-30 14:28): Since we're talking texting.  I sent this last night because I felt like it.  If she doesn't reply, any ideas?  Although don't distract yourself from my Alison problem earlier...
Nate (2013-10-30 14:28): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/085ebb8023bf0131c1102251565bbad1
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:29): I think I just stopped time in GayLife
Nate (2013-10-30 14:29) (1x <3): The silence is beautiful
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:30): Everyone just took a moment to introspect
Nate (2013-10-30 14:30): @Xander if she doesn't reply, I was gonna wait till tomorrow and change the subject.  Want your input tho
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:30) (1x <3): Alright, let me go look at that
Nate (2013-10-30 14:31): Look at the first one though, I don't care nearly as much about this chick
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:33): mmmm eating some salad cause I'm a vagina
Mark (2013-10-30 14:33): holy shit
Mark (2013-10-30 14:33): Sandeep's text
Mark (2013-10-30 14:33): wtf
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:33): what what?!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:34): Hahaha!
TiMex (2013-10-30 14:34): Lmao
Mark (2013-10-30 14:34): https://i.groupme.com/9abf0a9023bf0131ff0236387bfbb521.large
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:34): I don't even need to watch comedies any more
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:35): oh god 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:35) (1x <3): So. much. cringe.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:35): its like reading a roosh post except I know him
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:35): It's like the polar opposite of what roosh would text
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:36): Sigh...I feel so bad for the guy
Nate (2013-10-30 14:36): I need to read more roosh
Mark (2013-10-30 14:36): guys, if i ever send out a text like that, please chemically castrate me
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:36): Beta4Lyfe!
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:36): Small-balls-till-we-die nigga!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:37): If I take any noobs out to run game, I'm gonna bring red and yellow flags with me so I can toss them in their faces whenever they fuck up
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:37): bring cards
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:37): and hand them yellow and red cards
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:37): red card means go home 
Mark (2013-10-30 14:37) (1x <3): and a whistle
Nate (2013-10-30 14:37) (1x <3): @Xander compared to what I saw when I went to bootcamps, Sandeep is pretty good
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:37): hhahah
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:37) (2x <3): I have a feeling that I'll be handing out quite a lot of red cards
Mark (2013-10-30 14:38): seriously Nate
Mark (2013-10-30 14:38): which bootcamp
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:38): don't say ben and charley 
Nate (2013-10-30 14:39): @Mark Love Systems.  It was a mix of people who were actually quite good, and people who were 1 step away from 40 yr old virgin.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:39): I believe it. Sandeep is a highly functional beta. There were probably some lesser betas/greater omegas attending
Mark (2013-10-30 14:40): i don't know about highly functional
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:40) (2x <3): 
Mark
leave a voicemail and don't say anything, just breathe heavily into the phone
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:40): Hahaha!
Nate (2013-10-30 14:40): Ben and Charlies was actually not bad.  There was 6 people and 4 of them approached a lot with varying degrees of skill, and 2 needed a bit of hand holding.  Of those 2, 1 eventually approached once near the end, and the other did 5 or 6 in the last half.
Mark (2013-10-30 14:40): damn
Mark (2013-10-30 14:40) (1x <3): if i'm gonna pay for that shit, i'm doing at least 50 approaches
Nate (2013-10-30 14:41) (1x <3): AA is really tough for some people to get over
Mark (2013-10-30 14:41) (1x <3): i'm in that boat still Nate
Nate (2013-10-30 14:41): When I was there I had already done 3 approaches before Ben and Charlie showed up.   When they got there I was number closing a girl.
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:41) (2x <3): Has anybody met A E?
Mark (2013-10-30 14:41): you don't need any help 
Mark (2013-10-30 14:41): beast mode
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:41) (1x <3): More people have rated fear of public speaking as their #1 than fear of death
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:42) (1x <3): Approach anxiety can't be much different
Nate (2013-10-30 14:42): @Mark yeah in the beginning it's really tough.  When I started doing day game I was like that.  Frequently took me 1 or 2 hours to get up the nerve.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:42): I have @Jimmyayo
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:42) (1x <3): @Jimmyayo A E met me, Phil and Marcus at Niagara last Friday
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:42): He didn't approach a single time during the night, and rationalized that it was because he didn't see anything he liked
Nate (2013-10-30 14:43): @Xander yeah that excuse was so pathetic
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:43): How's his energy?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:43): I saw dozens of attractive girls throughout the night
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:43): no energy very much AA
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:43): He's low energy, doesn't talk much
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:43): but a cool guy
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:43): Doesn't even joke that much
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:43): In person
Nate (2013-10-30 14:43) (1x <3): He may just have been very nervous
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:43): Yeah, he seemed chill, but wouldn't want him as a wing, for sure
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:44): he probably was star struck by me Xander and mark
Nate (2013-10-30 14:44): @Phil very likely didn't help
Nate (2013-10-30 14:44): You guys are light years better
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:45): This text works ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/527fb19023c10131df9626b8d04074be
Mark (2013-10-30 14:45): i like that text, but it calls attention to her not responding, otherwise i'd use it
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:45): I like the noob Casmsaw He's green, but I see great potential in him
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:46): you meet him?
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:46): anyone meet Casmsaw
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:46): Yes
Nate (2013-10-30 14:46) (1x <3): A E strikes me as someone at the very beginning of his gaming career.  Even though I haven't met him, your description says he could benefit from a real bootcamp with good trainers.
Mark (2013-10-30 14:46): Casmsaw sounds like a pokemon
Nate (2013-10-30 14:46): Never met Casmsaw
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:46): He's green?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:47) (1x <3): He was a few feet away from you @Phillatio when you got your green sweater from me, and had that wacko Chinese chick with you
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:47) (1x <3): He's brown @Marcus
Mark (2013-10-30 14:47): yeah, he's plant type
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:47): No he isn't, he's white
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:47): Like white mana
Nate (2013-10-30 14:47): Radishes are white
Mark (2013-10-30 14:47): toast is brown
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:47): Is he a ufo
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:48): @Mark Speaking of which, I checked my 3DS tracking info today. It was delivered to Secaucus this morning. It's a mere 6 miles away from me
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:49): Casmsaw is a whitey
Mark (2013-10-30 14:49) (1x <3): i'm going to play vicariously through you
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:50): @xander who are the net players that live in the building
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:50): He's dual type grass/normal
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:50) (1x <3): @Marcus Are you serious? I don't fucking know anything about sports
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:51): Haha me too
Nate (2013-10-30 14:51): @Xander any thoughts on my first texting dilemma :)
Nate (2013-10-30 14:51): Sports?  Is that where they play chess?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:51): @Nate Aw shit! I knew I was forgetting something
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:51): Sports: Fun to play, boring to watch
Nate (2013-10-30 14:51): Golf
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:53): Hey, I found Casmsaw:
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:53) (2x <3): http://pldh.net/media/sugimori/585-summer.png
Mark (2013-10-30 14:53) (1x <3): WB
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:53): If he keeps at it, he could turn into this one day:
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:53) (1x <3): http://pldh.net/media/sugimori/586-summer.png
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:54) (1x <3): finally a worth while avatar
Nate (2013-10-30 14:54): needs cropping
Mark (2013-10-30 14:54): uh oh
Mark (2013-10-30 14:54): it has begun
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:55): http://pokiidex.com/Content/Images/585Deerling.png
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:56): Oh sooo cute
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:56): That one's square
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:57): thanks @Xander Xone
Mark (2013-10-30 14:57): alright
Nate (2013-10-30 14:57): @jimmy you're like half trolling him now
Phillatio (2013-10-30 14:57): zombie pikachu?
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 14:57): Oh lord...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:57): Haha
Nate (2013-10-30 14:58): aaaand I have another meeting, fun.
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:59): Xander I think u can make money off sandeep
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:59): @Marcus Probably. He seems to have cash to burn
Marcus (2013-10-30 14:59): He used to pay Ben and gol 150 a night
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 14:59): Jesus...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:00): I would probably be able to help him out way more than they could
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:00): He needs me to deconstruct his flawed beliefs and thought processes
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:00): Charge him 200 a night. He will do it
Mark (2013-10-30 15:01) (1x <3): wait, he got coaching and is still like this?
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:03): Yup.
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:04): I felt Ben and gol coaching was useless
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:04): Superficial changes aren't going to affect his core belief structure
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:05): He's beta to the bone
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:05) (2x <3): I need to give him an exorcism
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:05): Xander PM and tell him u will give him classes
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:05): I think they used to do 5 hrs
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:06) (1x <3): he'l probably do it
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:06): Maybe I'll offer half n half
Mark (2013-10-30 15:06) (1x <3): jeez for $150 i expect at least a handjob
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:06): Vivisect his mind for a while, then send him out into the field
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:08): OMFG
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:08): Mr. Ltd is STILL sending messages to that chick!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:09): And she hasn't responded once
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:09): ugh
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:09): I'm glad I left
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:10): It's okay, I think I found a way to make rent
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:11): I was lost too why he was sending another text
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:11): So i looked closer
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:11): Yes Xander you have
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:11): Why is Ltd still thinking about it? Stop fucking obsessing over it
Mark (2013-10-30 15:11) (2x <3): i believe that's called the scarcity mindset
Mark (2013-10-30 15:14): is the text scheduler only on android?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:15): Most likely
Marcus (2013-10-30 15:15): I think there maybe one on the iPhone but not built into the messaging app like on the andriod.
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:18): yea ^ whatever just freakin remember
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 15:18) (2x <3): ^ Or forget
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 15:24): https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/q71/1379336_10151705394772548_1352703462_n.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 15:25): Free entry + open vodka bar @ Cielo
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:25): that's tonight
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:25): ja
Nate (2013-10-30 15:25): @Xander don't forget my texting issue :)
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:25): Shiiiiiit!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:26): Fuckin' Jacky Ly has been PMing me with text problems too
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:26): I don't have time for that shiiiiiit
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:26) (1x <3): you'll have to ignore
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 15:27) (1x <3): Xander seriously don't waste ur time w/ Jacky
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:27) (1x <3): I don't even ask you anymore. I know I have to schedule it with your secretary 
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 15:27) (1x <3): He doesn't approach
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:28): @Jimmayayo I'm not sure I even know who the fuck he is
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:31): He's gonna have to start paying me if he hits me up for any more text advice
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:32): lol 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:32): dude 
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:32): Even Sandeep fucking approaches
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:32): seriously offer him a text seminar
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:32): and charge him like 50 bucks or something
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:32): at least you'll both feel like you're getting a good deal
Nate (2013-10-30 15:36) (2x <3): I'll consider Xander being able to drunk dial me at 2am as payment enough for the help
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:37): @Nate I was quite Lucid
Nate (2013-10-30 15:37): Sure
Nate (2013-10-30 15:37): at 2am :)
Nate (2013-10-30 15:38) (1x <3): Gonna day game at 6 if anyone is interested
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:38) (1x <3): me and Mark are doing the same
Nate (2013-10-30 15:39): cool
Nate (2013-10-30 15:39): If my date happens tonight, it'll be later so I have plenty of time
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:40): 
The Xubermensch
I didn't realize you were in the hood
That's awesome
Sandeep Patel
lol da hood
with all dem fob azn bitches
i swear it'll pain me so much to move into the city and reduce the access to such a great demographic
Nate (2013-10-30 15:42): Yeah compared to Just Jacky, Sandeep is a pickup god
Nate (2013-10-30 15:43) (1x <3): He may have serious inner game issues, but he's trying hard and I respect that
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:44): Jeeze...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:44): Omegas4Lyfe!
Nate (2013-10-30 15:45): Ignore their pm's for a while and help me <stamps foot>
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:46): Okay, I will
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:46): I'm just trying to get $$$
Nate (2013-10-30 15:46): Fair point
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:46): honestly I think you should
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:46): I would but I don't need they money as much
Phillatio (2013-10-30 15:47): and i don't have the patience
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:47) (1x <3): Says the teacher
Nate (2013-10-30 15:47): Well I told myself I'm not daygaming with anyone from that chat unless they are good at it or they pay me.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:47): Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:47) (1x <3): Sandeep could actually use a site like Chateau Heartiste/Rational Male
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:48): Yes, I'm aware, lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:48): i mean, it may ruin him and he will probably run with it too far (like many of those readers do)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:48): but he is lacking that alpha attitude
Nate (2013-10-30 15:49): Last time I went daygaming with Sandeep he spent the whole time making excuses and trying to rationalize to me.  He just wasn't fun to hang with
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:51): Nate, take him to grand central
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:51) (1x <3): put some hair on his balls
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:51) (2x <3): Yeah, that's why I'm not just going to run game. I'm going to give him some one-on-one mindfucking
Nate (2013-10-30 15:51) (2x <3): Difference here is even when you guys aren't approaching with me, I enjoy hanging with you
Nate (2013-10-30 15:52): @Pippy I had him at Union Square, and Thompkin Square Park, and flatiron
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:54) (1x <3): thats mighty generous of u Nate-dawg
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:55) (3x <3): Sandeep prob ought to lift weights, get some cool friends, read some kind of dark-side blog (or just learn how to read Xander's mind lol) and he'd be straight
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 15:55): poor guy
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 15:55) (2x <3): @Nate You had your WAY with him, more like!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 16:08) (1x <3): Woohoo, looks like I'm gonna coach Sandeep
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:08): nice
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:08): how much
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 16:08): I'm gonna have to work for every cent...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 16:08): Not sure yet
Nate (2013-10-30 16:11): Five... Billion dollars
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 16:13): *rupees*
Nate (2013-10-30 16:13) (2x <3): Ecstatic charged him 150 and then hung out with me most of the time, you should be able to get that at least
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 16:16): Jeeze...
Marcus (2013-10-30 16:17) (1x <3): Xander I will run u on how Ecstatic (ben) and gol (jay) did the coaching.
Nate (2013-10-30 16:27): Got real quiet all of a sudden
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:28): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b83de80023cf013102150efee35410da
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:28): hi NOISEEEEEEEEE
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:28): what do you think. I told her she should grow her hair out
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:31): I might like this girl too much I think
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:31) (2x <3): well I don't like her I just think she's gorgeous 
Mark (2013-10-30 16:36): "you know what's not boring? me"
Nate (2013-10-30 16:36): Isn't that playing into her frame?
Mark (2013-10-30 16:36): just continuing the thread
Mark (2013-10-30 16:37): you can also change topic, that works too
Mark (2013-10-30 16:37): coffee/tea is a kinda meh topic
Nate (2013-10-30 16:37) (1x <3): if you're gonna continue that thread, i'd go with "I know you are, but what am I"
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:37): lol
Marcus (2013-10-30 16:38): You do u, I do me
Nate (2013-10-30 16:38): I do you
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:38): yea might be better to change the topic here
Marcus (2013-10-30 16:38) (2x <3): You do me, I do me
Mark (2013-10-30 16:38): or you can say 'once you switch over to tea, you're going to grow out your hair next like we talked about'
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:40): yeah i'm gonna go with that ^
Mark (2013-10-30 16:40): you can smoothly transition into talking about her body after that
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:44): her response: "I can't. I tried I just miss coffee too much. haha. It doesn't just happen next. It takes a while silly"
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:45): "you just aren't living up to my standards"
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:45): lol nah I wouldn't say that
Mark (2013-10-30 16:47): i like that frame
Mark (2013-10-30 16:48): maybe something like 'you sure know how to disappoint a man'
Nate (2013-10-30 16:48) (1x <3): well she fell into your frame of telling her what to do, which is good
Mark (2013-10-30 16:49): 'but i'm a generous guy so i'll let you make it up to me'
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:49): lolll ^
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:49): that's fucking gold @Mark
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:49): my brain shuts down when I think he girl is attractive
Nate (2013-10-30 16:49) (3x <3): I think Mark is #2 in texting here
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:49): agreed
Mark (2013-10-30 16:50): i'm blushing
Mark (2013-10-30 16:50): i think that happens to all of us, when we really like a girl, it's game over
Nate (2013-10-30 16:51): Remember kids, if you want to get in their pants, a few compliments sprinkled in doesn't hurt
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:52): jesus she literally texts back the next second
Mark (2013-10-30 16:52): yeah after a bunch of teasing, a well phrased compliment is awesome
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:53): like she's waiting for me
Mark (2013-10-30 16:53): the more personalized and unexpected the copmliment the better
Nate (2013-10-30 16:53): @Mark I was referring to you ;)
Mark (2013-10-30 16:53): lol
Mark (2013-10-30 16:54) (1x <3): you're pretty good at complimenting Nate
Nate (2013-10-30 16:54): @phil probably because she is waiting for you
Nate (2013-10-30 16:54): lol @Mark
Mark (2013-10-30 16:54): ;)
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:54): ah she had something to say, I saw her typing, but she erased it. 
Mark (2013-10-30 16:54): eager beaver
Nate (2013-10-30 16:55): mmm beaver
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:55): I'm not sure if those texts give her room to respond
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:55): the "but I'm a generous guy so I'll let you make it up to me"
Mark (2013-10-30 16:55): she's trying hard to think of a response
Mark (2013-10-30 16:56): investing a lot into the convo
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:56): gotcha
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:56): this is the first time I responded in less than 2 hours
Nate (2013-10-30 16:57) (4x <3): I love crowdsourcing texting
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:58): yes same lol
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:58): I love it too much
Phillatio (2013-10-30 16:58): I need to do this shit on my own
Nate (2013-10-30 16:58) (1x <3): Given that I've been hounding Xander all day, I'm not confident enough yet :)
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:00): @Nate Hey man, I've been busy working on a new calling script for some code calling bullshit I have to do
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:01): *cold calling
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:01): I'm probably not gonna be able to help you til I get off of work at 6:30
Nate (2013-10-30 17:01): No problem, I just wanted to make sure I got you before your date
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:01): For sure
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:07): @Phillatio Change the damn subject!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:08) (1x <3): You're talking like 70 year old married people
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:08): yep this is my problem
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:10): well I got no response from that
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:10): I'll leave it be for a day or so
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:10): I wanna ask her out this weekend
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:11): I've forgotten about most of my girls. Time to go back through my phone/spreadsheet later tonight
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:12): @Jimmyayo Lol, "Congrats!"
Nate (2013-10-30 17:29): Where are ppl meeting after work?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:30): Okay, I just rescheduled my date for tonight
Nate (2013-10-30 17:30): lol why
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:30): She has to catch an a train out of the city at 8:30 and I wouldn't be able to get to Solas before 7:30
Nate (2013-10-30 17:30): oh that makes sense
Nate (2013-10-30 17:30): Thats really early to have to catch a train
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:31): She suggested rescheduling, not me
Nate (2013-10-30 17:31): No sex for xander.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:31): So she is still interested
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:31): Whatever
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:31) (1x <3): Sex is overrated. The conquest leading up to it is far more exhilarating
Nate (2013-10-30 17:32): I actually like the sex part
Mark (2013-10-30 17:32): sex? where?
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:32) (1x <3): @Nate Then ur gay
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:32): wtf is going on in here
Nate (2013-10-30 17:32) (1x <3): Yep, liking sex with women makes me gay.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:33): @Nate Exactly
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:33): this is some backwards talk
Mark (2013-10-30 17:33): GAY
Nate (2013-10-30 17:33): I assure you we don't know
Mark (2013-10-30 17:33) (2x <3): now, sex with a man on the other hand, fucking alpha as shit
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:33): Just ask the Greeks
Nate (2013-10-30 17:34): yeah but only if your the only shoving the dick in
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:34): I fucked guys like you in prison
Nate (2013-10-30 17:34): the one*
Mark (2013-10-30 17:34): you can't bat all the time
Mark (2013-10-30 17:34): sometimes you gotta pitch
Nate (2013-10-30 17:35): Not according to the greeks
Nate (2013-10-30 17:35): pitching is for slaves
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:35): "haha ohh really.what was on your mind? I'll let you braid my hair ha" 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:35): her response
Nate (2013-10-30 17:36): she just turned it around, now your being her bitch
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:36): okay this conversation got a bit better
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:36): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3604ab9023d90131df9626b8d04074be
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:36) (1x <3): well its better than talking about tea
Mark (2013-10-30 17:36): nice Phil
Mark (2013-10-30 17:36): say "i'd tell you what i'm thinking now, but it's really inappropriate"
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:37): hahah I get fucking nervous sending shit like that
Mark (2013-10-30 17:37): alpha = risk taker
Mark (2013-10-30 17:37): do eet
Mark (2013-10-30 17:37): and it's not like super overt winnn stuff
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:37): I wonder if Carrie is going to flake on her other responsibilities to hang out with me
Nate (2013-10-30 17:40): or go on a murderous rampage
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:40): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/c7ef0fa023d901316c39466be5090bc3
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:40) (1x <3): you already posted that @Xander Xone
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:40): Whoops, I meant to post this:
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:41): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ebc8149023d90131df9626b8d04074be
Nate (2013-10-30 17:41): Xander ownage
Nate (2013-10-30 17:41) (1x <3): Don't forget to answer my question before date, or I'm screwed
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:43): oh nice @Xander Xone
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:43): what was your question @Nate lets open it up to the group
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:44): http://i.groupme.com/ad8e661023b801310b241eec51a0be4e
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:44): @Nate Was it this one?
Nate (2013-10-30 17:44): yeah
Nate (2013-10-30 17:44): I met her going to her first day of work 2 days ago
Nate (2013-10-30 17:44): I liked her
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:44): And your question was... how do you respond, I assume
Nate (2013-10-30 17:44): I want to get to a date with her
Nate (2013-10-30 17:44): yeah, I need to respond with something that eventually gets me to a date, possibly sunday or early next week
Nate (2013-10-30 17:45): she's doing the 1 day turnaround on texts...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:45): You're going to have to do some more bantering
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:45): Dayum
Nate (2013-10-30 17:45): I know, and I suck at that
Nate (2013-10-30 17:45): I don't want to lose this one to texting if I can avoid it
Mark (2013-10-30 17:46): the optimal texting strategy always implies some sort of risk
Mark (2013-10-30 17:46): high risk/high reward kind of thing
Nate (2013-10-30 17:46): well yeah, but my texting calibration is really bad
Nate (2013-10-30 17:47): so if I'm gonna risk, I might as well risk with the experts
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:48) (1x <3): maybe I should just imagine we're in person.. I always have some random bullshit to say in person
Nate (2013-10-30 17:50): I recognized 'that' quality that I look for in women, so I'm having trouble even thinking of responses because I made it important
Mark (2013-10-30 17:51) (1x <3): she sounds like a yellow light... more pinging is needed i think before making the ask
Nate (2013-10-30 17:51): I agree
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:51): Definitely
Nate (2013-10-30 17:51): This is always where I fuck it up though.  
Mark (2013-10-30 17:51): she is also likely to be super busy from her job, so you may need to wait a while until she becomes a green light
Nate (2013-10-30 17:52): she just started, it's not gonna become less busy
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:52): Maybe the weekend, during the day is a good time to strike
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:52): When she isn't being raped by work
Nate (2013-10-30 17:52): I feel like if I wait that long to reply tho I'll be dead
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:53): You should change the subject real quick
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:53): She probably doesn't want to talk about her stressful job
Nate (2013-10-30 17:53): This is literally my weakest area.  Yellow light girls are in this situation exactly are where I crash and burn 90% of the time
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:54): Just say something random
Nate (2013-10-30 17:54): Almost every time I try to move to green light here I end up killing it
Mark (2013-10-30 17:54) (1x <3): keep pinging every few days and if on one occasion she starts responding faster, make the ask
Nate (2013-10-30 17:55): what does 'make the ask' mean?
Mark (2013-10-30 17:55): ask for a meet
Nate (2013-10-30 17:56): I know, I'm almost afraid of what I say.  I have sandeep levels of texting skill.  You should see some of the crap I do.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:56): Mark is absolutely spot on
Nate (2013-10-30 17:56): For reason this aspect of game never clicked with me
Nate (2013-10-30 17:57): Remember the crap sandeep was saying for his 'random' stuff, that's me
Mark (2013-10-30 17:57): pings are tough, i don't blame Sandeep for dropping the ball there
Nate (2013-10-30 17:58): I know, and I drop the ball nearly every time myself
Mark (2013-10-30 17:58): a good ping will be funny, quirky, original and unpredictable
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:58): @Nate Pretend that you're me for a second. What would you say in this moment?
Nate (2013-10-30 17:58): I'm just getting better at creating green light girls from the beginning.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:58): I can give you material, but I want you to struggle through this one
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:58): I like some of my pings 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:58) (2x <3): "just made some bread"
Mark (2013-10-30 17:58): ^ that's a winner
Phillatio (2013-10-30 17:59): lol 
Nate (2013-10-30 17:59): :)
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 17:59): @Nate Damnit, I want you to be creative!
Nate (2013-10-30 17:59): Just had pumpkin pie for dinner
Nate (2013-10-30 17:59): lame
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:00): What's an interesting or weird thing that pops into your head at the moment
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:00): Something you might have come across today that struck you as peculiar
Nate (2013-10-30 18:00): hmm
Nate (2013-10-30 18:01): ugh I'm having writers block because I'm in my head right now
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:01): "I just had way too much fiber. I may have to renovate my bathroom"
Nate (2013-10-30 18:02): lol
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:02): Hahaha
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 18:02): Getting hit on by a gay guy
Nate (2013-10-30 18:02): Maybe I shouldn't have asked for extra hot sauce
Mark (2013-10-30 18:03) (2x <3): when i get stuck, sometimes i'll go on twitter and browse around
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 18:03): Asking homeless person for directions but he asked for a dollar
Mark (2013-10-30 18:03): lots of funny, witty concise tweets perfect for texts
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:03): "I like habanero sauce"
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:03): There you go
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:03): Complete non sequitur
Mark (2013-10-30 18:03): lmao
Mark (2013-10-30 18:04) (2x <3): "i like habanero sauce. my ass doesn't"
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:04): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:04): I don't recommend adding that last part, but sure
Nate (2013-10-30 18:04): lol
Mark (2013-10-30 18:04): alright now we're just trolling
Mark (2013-10-30 18:05) (1x <3): we should compile a book of pings and sell that shit
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:05) (1x <3): I wasn't trolling about the habanero sauce one
Nate (2013-10-30 18:06): "I like srirachi sauce"... "They call it cock sauce"
Nate (2013-10-30 18:06): @Xander I know
Mark (2013-10-30 18:07): when all else fails, i like to go with "what mischief have you been causing today?"
Mark (2013-10-30 18:07): works pretty well, but only use it once ofc
Nate (2013-10-30 18:07): yeah
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:07): ofc?
Mark (2013-10-30 18:07): but that's like a last resort
Nate (2013-10-30 18:07): of course
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:07): oh
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:07): @Nate The problem is that you're trying to avoid signaling your great interest
Mark (2013-10-30 18:07) (1x <3): that's why he has us
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:08): Sending flippant, playful one-liners is a way of masking that
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:08): They are also conversation bait
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:09): I mean, I've sent shit like, "God is good!"
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:09): "Some crazy guy told me that today when I was getting coffee"
Nate (2013-10-30 18:10): That second one would drive her nuts, cause it's the end not the beginning
Nate (2013-10-30 18:10): oh those are together :)
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:10): Yeah, like I send the first one
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:10): And let it linger for several minutes
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:11): Then send the next one
Mark (2013-10-30 18:11): maybe you can accidentally a word
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:11) (2x <3): It's like I want them to think that maybe I'm a religious freak for a second
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:12): pretty good
Mark (2013-10-30 18:12): oh i have another good one: "almost died today on my way home from work"
Mark (2013-10-30 18:12): that always gets a response
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:12): Of course, that did actually happen to me
Mark (2013-10-30 18:12): be prepared to follow up with a story
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:12): The "God is good" guy
Mark (2013-10-30 18:12): that can be your story
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:12): "God is good" then he tried to kill me
Nate (2013-10-30 18:12): lol
Mark (2013-10-30 18:13): "almost died on my way home from work today" is slightly better
Nate (2013-10-30 18:14): "it's a harrowing tale of a taxi, and the crossing that almost ended it all"
Mark (2013-10-30 18:14): go with the crazy religious hobo with a knife story
Mark (2013-10-30 18:14): i like that one
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:14): "I can't say over the phone.. nowhere is safe" 
Phillatio (2013-10-30 18:15): "I suggest you pack your things and stay at your mothers for a few days"
Mark (2013-10-30 18:15): haha
Nate (2013-10-30 18:15): if she doesn't laugh she'll think I'm nuts :)
Mark (2013-10-30 18:16): with those kind of absurd situations, you have to really go over the top to communicate humor
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:16) (1x <3): Lol, I didn't even answer her question confirming that I would be there. She'll assume so, but I love adding little bits of fear and doubt everywhere I can ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/e6f29eb023de0131df9626b8d04074be
Nate (2013-10-30 18:17): I brought a spoon and you brought a tank
Mark (2013-10-30 18:18): oh fuck i gotta get outta here... gym closes soon
Mark (2013-10-30 18:18) (1x <3): gluck Nate
Nate (2013-10-30 18:18): thanks
Nate (2013-10-30 18:19): not answering till later, on the chance I get her after work
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:19): Nate
I brought a spoon and you brought a tank
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:19): That's a good non sequitur text too, except maybe switching it around
Nate (2013-10-30 18:19): going day gaming now so I can find other girls to obsess about.
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:19): "You brought a spoon and I brought a tank"
Nate (2013-10-30 18:20): then she asks "What does that mean?"
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:20): And then... you're fucked!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:20): Because we're not there!
Nate (2013-10-30 18:20): basically
Nate (2013-10-30 18:21): I'm such a little bitch when it comes to this...
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:21) (1x <3): @Nate I'm your text game kryptonite
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 18:23): Well, I'm not really sure when this date wraps up, so I'll possibly be down to run some game depending on when it ends
Nate (2013-10-30 18:24) (2x <3): hopefully it ends late, with you in her bed
Nate (2013-10-30 18:51): Haha Russian bitch thought I was going to buy her a free drink just because I said hi to her
Nate (2013-10-30 18:56) (2x <3): She got all pissed when she realized I wasn't
Marcus (2013-10-30 19:44): Where u at nate

Marcus (2013-10-30 20:17): Cool. I will let u know how it is.
Nate (2013-10-30 20:21): Cool
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 21:11): I can tell this is coming to a close soon guys. Fucking txt me
Nate (2013-10-30 21:12) (1x <3): ok
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 21:16) (1x <3): LOL, Nathan is a better wing from afar than most are in person
Mark (2013-10-30 21:18): who's Nathan
Mark (2013-10-30 21:18): never heard of him
Nate (2013-10-30 21:18): Yeah who is that?
Mark (2013-10-30 21:18): no clue
Jimmyayo (2013-10-30 21:19): Date is going well, I'm actually surprised...
Nate (2013-10-30 21:19) (1x <3): Jimmy never thought he would fall in love with a fat girl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-30 21:19) (1x <3): +1 Jimmy, I admit I'm a bit surprised
Mark (2013-10-30 21:20) (3x <3): ever since he bought that korean bbq scented cologne, things have been coming up milhouse
Mark (2013-10-30 21:27) (1x <3): lol @ Sandeep misapplying GOL's texts verbatim in gaylife
Nate (2013-10-30 21:31) (1x <3): he jumped straight to the end without gol's buildup
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 22:13): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 22:13): I'm fucking drunk!
Xander Xone (2013-10-30 22:13) (2x <3): I might have to drink before I coach Sandeep
Marcus (2013-10-31 09:18): Good morning Y'all

Phillatio (2013-10-31 09:22): anything
Marcus (2013-10-31 09:31):    That would make a great fucking ad, wouldn’t it? Girl hanging out with her girlfriends tells them “I’m going out with this guy tonight, but I think he might be a loser.” She sends a text “What time is the play?” Cut to: guy dweebishly getting over excited he got the text. He tries to respond. No reception. He freaks out, thinking he’s ruining it. Her: “What time are you picking me up?” She’s visibly annoyed. 
Marcus (2013-10-31 09:31): Her: “Hello? Are you there?” Guy: at his phone, still no reception. She turns to her friends. “I was wrong. This guy is definitely a stud.”
Voice Over: “Verizon. The single man’s best friend.”

Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:35): for me
Jimmyayo (2013-10-31 11:35): I'll drink and party when I'm just out having fun w/ my friends, but when I'm out hunting, I need to focus on the task at hand
Jimmyayo (2013-10-31 11:35) (1x <3): And it's hard to improve when you don't remember shit
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:37): Srsly
Nate (2013-10-31 11:37): I've never had a blackout.
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:37): oh I've blacked out a few times
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:37): its not fun
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:38): I never really want to get that drunk
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:39) (2x <3): I'm going to go this entire week without drinking
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:40): I can't really be drinking while I'm coaching, either
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:41): yeah idk I'm going to continue down the dark path
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:41): I don't really ever go overboard 
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:41): During my date last night, I was racing through my margaritas without even noticing it
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:42): It was definitely a turn off
Marcus (2013-10-31 11:42): Xander when r u coaching
Mark (2013-10-31 11:42) (2x <3): i bet she looked better with each margarita
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:44): @Marcus Not sure. Probably after 7
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:44): @Mark She was already good looking
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:45) (1x <3): I only entertain the company of elegant women
Nate (2013-10-31 11:47): I prefer my women slutty
Marcus (2013-10-31 11:48): tonight @xander
Jimmyayo (2013-10-31 11:50) (3x <3): "I don't really ever go overboard" - - says the guy who's blacked out a few times
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:50): lol 
Nate (2013-10-31 11:50): If he can't remember it, did it happen?
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:50): not lately
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:50): ah its like that tree thing @Nate
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:50) (1x <3): @Marcus Yes, tonight
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:51): If he regrets sex, is it rape?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:51): whats going to be ur main focus on coaching sandeep
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:51) (2x <3): making him not be a little bitch anymore
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:52): Today's focus will be on his background, so I can understand where he's coming from
Nate (2013-10-31 11:52) (1x <3): The first thing you should do get him to remove everything about himself that says 'child molester'
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:53): sheesh lol
Mark (2013-10-31 11:53): baby steps Nate, baby steps
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:53): HAHA pun intended
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:53): well played @Mark
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:53): @Nate As I was saying last night, I'm going to log into his Tinder and OKCupid accounts and delete his bios
Nate (2013-10-31 11:53): lol @mark
Nate (2013-10-31 11:53): @pippy if you saw his tinder profile pic, you'd understand
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:54): oh man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:54): OP please deliver his tinder profiel pic
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:54) (1x <3): if its in the Closers gallery
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:54): ill go look
Mark (2013-10-31 11:54) (2x <3): on the plus side, he can use his tinder profile as his sexual offender registry profile without creating another one
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:54): But first I'm going to go through them and analyze everything that's wrong with what he's written and explain to him why it's not attractive to women
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:55): i mean Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:55): we are talking a full overhaul here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:55) (1x <3): i dont think the kid could grasp the better attitude he ought to enable
Mark (2013-10-31 11:55): he'll also need a new face
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:55): based off what i remember him spouting when I was in Gotham
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:55): Yes, that's why I'm bringing my deprogramming kit
Nate (2013-10-31 11:55) (1x <3): @Mark he just needs to tone down the smile and have more of a knowing smirk
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:56): Water boarding, testicle clamps, what have you
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:56): @Pippy Long Sausage™ it is in the gallery 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:56): ah damn, the Closers gallery doesnt go back far enough for a pic of sandeep
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:56): aw
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:56): i went only as far as page 4 but can go no further
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:56): Wow, wtf?
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 11:56): I guess that groupme has started capping that shit
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:57): its prob for the better honestly
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): which is bullshit
Nate (2013-10-31 11:57): Yeah that's annoying as fuck
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): I mean fuck you can't buy some more server space
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): cheap bastards
Nate (2013-10-31 11:57): I'd pay a monthly fee for a fucking search engine
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): they should have small ads
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): above the chat
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:57): like gmail
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58): yeah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58) (2x <3): Xander, props for helping out Sandeep
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58): but man. I mean, thats a hell of a task
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:58) (1x <3): well he's doing it for the money
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:58): I believe 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58): ahhhhhh lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58): okay
Phillatio (2013-10-31 11:58): so not too much props
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:58) (2x <3): 1/2 props lol
Jimmyayo (2013-10-31 11:58): What I really want from groupme, is to be able to click on a username and it showing a history of their posts
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:59): Oh God, why
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 11:59): uh i mean, yeah that sounds okay
Jimmyayo (2013-10-31 12:00): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:01): I don't have time to help him out unless I'm getting paid
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:02) (1x <3): But the way I see things, it's a win-win situation
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:02): yeah, hella curious as to what is the most optimist way to shed his beta mindset and demeanor
Nate (2013-10-31 12:02) (1x <3): @Pippy a good torture
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:03): okay I got a traveling dilema 
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:04): dilemma*
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:04) (1x <3): The thing is, if this goes decently, maybe I'll get ref'ed to some other n00bs
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:05) (1x <3): I can take an earlier train from paris to Enschede and risk missing but then I can party with my dutch girl or I can take a later train
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:06): not sure what to do
Marcus (2013-10-31 12:06): Risk it Phil
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:06): fuck 
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:06): maybe Ishould
Phillatio (2013-10-31 12:07): plus she wants to like do molly with me
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:07): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:08): @Phillatio I might have blown up shit with that Kate chick
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:08): Not that I give a damn
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:08): Also Xander, how long have u been doing this
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:08): GoL IMO didnt seem like a good teacher. it may be best to truly understand where student is coming from and their deficiencies
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:11): I have taught people a lot of shit before
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:12): Not necessarily pick up related, but I have been moving in that direction. I basically gave my friend in Indiana the equivalent of a bootcamp when I visited him
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:13): I used to be a bio TA in college, have taught little kids, etc.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:13): ok gotcha
Nate (2013-10-31 12:14) (1x <3): Little kids are the theme for this training
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:15): I plan on giving Sandeep as much value as I can. From what Nate told me, GoL basically ignored Sandeep for much of their sessions, and was generally shitty
Nate (2013-10-31 12:15) (1x <3): That was Ecstatic
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:15): Oh shit
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:15): Well, they're brothers
Nate (2013-10-31 12:16) (1x <3): And Sandeep took two sessions.  It was only the second one he was worse, but to be fair, Sandeep wasn't exactly listening either
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:16): Word. That's why I'm doing a half n half type thing
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:17): Not just 100% being out in the field. He's fine with approaching, he needs to be mindfucked
Nate (2013-10-31 12:17) (1x <3): Well he might be fine for approaching for night game, but I can tell you he needs a ton of work for day approaches...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:19): MINDFUCKED
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:19): yes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:19): whats ur Mindfuckery 101 Program look like
Nate (2013-10-31 12:19): Ecstatic/GOL made him do some stuff as exercises, and Sandeep didn't understand their purpose.  Last time we were out during daygame I tried to hard to spank out the really stupid stuff he was doing.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:19): stupid stuff....like what
Nate (2013-10-31 12:20): Walking up in front of girls, sticking your hands out in front of you, and saying "Stop" in order to approach
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:20): I remember the one time I hung out with him like 2 months ago, and I had to keep correcting his body language on his approaches
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:20): ah okay
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:21): He would basically just stand there like a pole
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:21) (1x <3): http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294\
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:21): u might want to point him to that book, it was a game changer
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-10-31 12:21): hands out the pockets, feed shoulder length apart, etc etc
Nate (2013-10-31 12:21): @Xander he doesn't remember the finer details.  Standing tall is only when you first approach, then you relax
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:24): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Thanks for that
Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:24): I have read this book, and it was pretty good: http://www.amazon.com/The-Definitive-Book-Body-Language/dp/0553804723/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1383236583&sr=8-2&keywords=body+language

Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:25): Awesome

Xander Xone (2013-10-31 12:26): Haha, alright

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:28): Ah, fuck it. Too late
Mark (2013-11-01 00:29): i just got home
Mark (2013-11-01 00:29): i dropped her off at the subway station
Mark (2013-11-01 00:30): have to wash my sheets now :(
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:30): Snl?
Mark (2013-11-01 00:30) (1x <3): yeah sorta
Mark (2013-11-01 00:30): didn't pick her up from a bar, dunno if that qualifies
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:30) (1x <3): Ah, you're home. Now I can go out
Mark (2013-11-01 00:31) (1x <3): that's why i mentioned it
Mark (2013-11-01 00:31): don't want to stifle your social life
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:31): I've been sick for like... over two weeks
Mark (2013-11-01 00:31): love sick?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:32): Aww shit! Maybe there's a correlation
Mark (2013-11-01 00:32): Dana's got your cock wrapped around her finger
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:33): Pretty much. It's time for me to go ghost on her
Mark (2013-11-01 00:33): once you penetrate her defenses, it
Mark (2013-11-01 00:33): will all be worth it
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:34): I wonder what would happen if I called her bluff and didn't contact her again
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:35): She was so fucking sure of herself at the end of our last date, when I was trying to weasel my way into her apartment
Mark (2013-11-01 00:35): what does she think this is? a fucking game?
Mark (2013-11-01 00:36) (1x <3): she's just begging for a mushroom stamp
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:36): "What if I don't contact you ever again?" "Oh, that's not going to happen" *shit-eating grin*
Mark (2013-11-01 00:36) (1x <3): she said that in person?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:37): Like I said, time for me to go ghost. Her hamster is going to go nuclear.
Mark (2013-11-01 00:38): yeah some more pushing would probably be good
Mark (2013-11-01 00:38): idk
Mark (2013-11-01 00:38) (1x <3): she needs to be put in her place
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:39): Not like I've put this girl through enough already, haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:39): But yes, I totally agree
Mark (2013-11-01 00:40) (1x <3): best remedy is to put her on the backburner and go game other girls
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:44): Indeed
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:44): I'm actually not going to contact her again
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:44): She'll hit me up eventually if she gives a shit
Mark (2013-11-01 00:46): ping of silence
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 00:49): As much as it pains me, because I really like this chick, I know it's what I must do
Mark (2013-11-01 01:40): how'd the coaching go btw
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 02:04): Fine. We did a lil 2 hour sesh
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 02:05) (1x <3): Mainly getting his background and going over shit. Didn't run any game, since not feeling well

Phillatio (2013-11-01 03:28): But that could have been sticky
Marcus (2013-11-01 03:28) (1x <3): Nice, I got a make out at Phebe's within 30sec of walking into that place
Phillatio (2013-11-01 03:29): Love phebes

Phillatio (2013-11-01 03:30): Probably

Nate (2013-11-01 10:58): I hope Xander didn't die, his texts were grim sounding
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 10:58): I'm feeling grim
Nate (2013-11-01 10:59): Did you go to the restaurant rated 'C'

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:01): No, that was after my intestinal trauma struck
Mark (2013-11-01 11:01): did anyone pull last night
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:01) (1x <3): I pulled Sandeep
Mark (2013-11-01 11:01): well duh

Mark (2013-11-01 11:04): she deleted her account right after sending that last msg
Mark (2013-11-01 11:04): i love these random nutcases on okc
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:04): wow 
Nate (2013-11-01 11:04): Someone has anger issues
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:04): what a crazy bitch
Mark (2013-11-01 11:05): she didn't have any pics showing her face, so i'm guessing she was ugly and bitter
Mark (2013-11-01 11:05): still pretty amusing
Nate (2013-11-01 11:06): Who doesn't want to be called a free spirit.  It's like someone hating being called fun
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 11:07) (1x <3): "I hate it when random ppl message me on Tinder, it's like wtf who are u????"
Nate (2013-11-01 11:07) (1x <3): "I just came to this bar to sit her and read"
Nate (2013-11-01 11:08): *here

Mark (2013-11-01 11:17): even though i woke up early ha
Marcus (2013-11-01 11:18) (3x <3): Phil buy a box of condoms before u buy a box of diapers 
Nate (2013-11-01 11:21) (1x <3): Phil doesn't believe in condoms
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 11:21): He doesn't fuck girls if they're not on the pill?
TiMex (2013-11-01 11:22) (5x <3): No he fucks them and hopes they're on the pill :P
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 11:22): Ah
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 11:23): Fuck first, abort later
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:23): right
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:23) (2x <3): Abortion? That's why God gave you fists
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:23): well I make sure they're pro choice
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:23): no conservative bitches for me
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:23): they won't be able to abort my bastard children
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:36): Phil, if you run for office, you will be the first pro-abortion candidate
Nate (2013-11-01 11:37): I think there are already a few of those :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:37): What are people doing tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:38): I have nothing on my agenda
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:38): I'm going to Baltimore
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:38): and actually
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:38) (2x <3): let me pre-face that, I will make an effort to meet everyone hopefully in the next couple weeks
Nate (2013-11-01 11:39): I hope you have family there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:40): friends
Nate (2013-11-01 11:40): ahh
Nate (2013-11-01 11:40) (3x <3): Baltimore is one step above going on vacation to Detroit ;)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:40): dude
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:41): gentrification has done wonders for certain areas
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 11:41): but i agree
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:44): @Mark and I have a date with destiny this weekend
Nate (2013-11-01 11:45): Mark does like the white ones
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:47): We're going to meet, and a singularity even will occur. All PUAs in the world will spontaneously combust
Mark (2013-11-01 11:47): i don't see color thank you very much
Nate (2013-11-01 11:47): @Mark isn't that what I said?
Mark (2013-11-01 11:48): in person? i don't recall
Nate (2013-11-01 11:49): My sarcasm isn't coming off, but that was my intention here
Mark (2013-11-01 11:50) (1x <3): not gonna lie, i'll be a bit nervous when i meet Xander
Mark (2013-11-01 11:50): might need to pop a viagra beforehand 
Nate (2013-11-01 11:50): Don't worry, he likes to cuddle
Mark (2013-11-01 11:51) (3x <3): he seems rather down in the dumps lately, might as well take advantage
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:51): all is fair in love and war
Mark (2013-11-01 11:53) (1x <3): been watching a lot of californication lately, hank moody is my daily dose of alpha
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:53): Aw, fuck it. Maybe I'll just stay in and play more Pokemon
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:53) (1x <3): I said that to a girl last night
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:53): went over pretty well
Mark (2013-11-01 11:53): you're quite the romantic Phil
Mark (2013-11-01 11:53): did you stick it in her butt afterwards?
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:53) (1x <3): yep 
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:54) (1x <3): oh I did the finger trick last night with ellen
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:54): @Mark Now you're stealing lines from girls
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:54) (1x <3): her vaginal walls are pretty thick though
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:54): Glad to hear it. Don't want needless tearing to occur
Phillatio (2013-11-01 11:54): so no finger masturbation/sex
Mark (2013-11-01 11:55): girl last night had a diaphragm on
Mark (2013-11-01 11:55): my finger kept on stabbing it
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:55): Da fuck...
Mark (2013-11-01 11:55): no bueno
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:55): What is this, the 1970s?
Mark (2013-11-01 11:55) (1x <3): dm;hs
Nate (2013-11-01 11:55): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-7IV2qryiQ
Mark (2013-11-01 11:56): my onyx made her cloister faint
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:57): Well, I know for sure Dana is on the pill now
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:57): Game on.
Nate (2013-11-01 11:57): How did you ask that one?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:57): I dunno. It somehow came up shortly after she got super offended at me for "bringing up a debt"
Nate (2013-11-01 11:58) (1x <3): "I hate you... I'm on the pill"
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:58): When I asked her to buy me a drink, and was like "You owe me anyway"
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:58) (2x <3): Love and hate, two sides of the same coin.
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 11:59) (1x <3): Anyway, I'm looking for some pussy, some cunt and some butthole this weekend
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:00) (1x <3): In the words of that Unforgivable dude
TiMex (2013-11-01 12:01): Anyone got good pics of last night?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:04): I'm gonna go run some mad game tonight. Might be making some girls cry during my rampage
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:06): Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:06): legit serious q, how was last night w/ Sanderp
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:07): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Pretty good
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:08): Delved deep into his past
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:08): oh god
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:08): please do tell
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:08): i guess he was picked on in middle/high-school
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:08): I would, but it was told in confidence
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:08): ok understood
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:09): He's a nice guy, just has to get over his limiting beliefs
Nate (2013-11-01 12:10): @Xander and his fears, which are at the source of many of those beliefs
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:13): @Nate Indeed
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:15): good on u tho man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:15): what ur doing will pay off in spades
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:15): i helped an AFC friend out of a bad break up last year.  first 2-3 months was him unwinding sh1tty beliefs, he even underwent therapy to unlock a lot of his insecurities
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:16): from his first date and how to plan logistics, how to not be a mega chode in text and in person, controlling the frame
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:16): it's all very rewarding to see improvement esp. if u had some kind of influence over it
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:16): yeah honestly
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:17): therapy is a good choice for some of these guys
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:17): yepppppppp
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:17): people shouldn't dismiss it so easily
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:17): there's no shame in it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:17): just think
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:17): one sexual rejection in high-school/middle school can fuck u up for a longggg time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:17): multiply that by 20
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:17): or getting made fun of or bullied. one weekend bootcmap wont fix that
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:18): yea
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:18): Truly
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:19): Or you can be like me, where you still get laid because you've weaponized your inner game issues
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:19): weaponized?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:19): how
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:20): Using the dark side of the force
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:21): And electrocuting bitches with your force lightning
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:21): yeah i dont have the resources to do that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:21): was it a certain book, certain belief
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:22): I'm not sure. Coming to the red pill and being an evolutionary psychology nerd, because of majoring in bio in college
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:22): It was some combination of the two
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:23): Humans are born broken, and we'll always be broken. The Darwinian rot runs deep
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:23) (1x <3): so its kinda like, if red pill says that 30+ women hit the wall and lose their looks....then its easier to assume a higher value frame and run the show as opposed to how you used to
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:23): makes sense
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:23) (1x <3): 1) Sperm Wars 2) Selfish Gene are good books then for that
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:24): Richard Dawkins is my personal saint
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:24): The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People is also terrific
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:25): did u read the red queen
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:25): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Yes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:26): worth checking out?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:27): I don't know what your major was, but most likely worthwhile
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:28) (1x <3): biz major lol, i just find this stuff fascinating
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:28): Basically, sex only exists as a tool in the arms race against parasites
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:29): At least, at this time, that's the only reasonable explanation biologists can come up with, since sex is so energetically expensive compared to asexual reproduction
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:31) (1x <3): Quote of the day via @Krauserpua "Pump n dump is the male LJBF"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:32): lol true
Mark (2013-11-01 12:33) (1x <3): women are the gatekeepers of sex, men are the gatekeepers of commitment 
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:36) (2x <3): @Mark Therefore, just as a slut is considered low value because of giving sex away so freely, the beta male is considered low value for offering up his commitment easily
Mark (2013-11-01 12:37): exactement
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:38): That was a real revelatory moment for Sandeep last night when I pointed that out to him 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:39) (1x <3): http://laidnyc.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/the-parable-of-mark-and-lauren/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:39): tthat blogpost covers that topic pretty well
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-01 12:39): real eye opener
Nate (2013-11-01 12:40): @Xander pointed out what?
Nate (2013-11-01 12:40): the @Mark thing?
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:41): Well, he basically knew the first line that Mark said, but I explained the greater implications of that reality
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:41): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Love that blog
Mark (2013-11-01 12:42): problem is, commitment is a much more abstract concept than sex
Mark (2013-11-01 12:42): real life application is often difficult because of this
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:43): Indeed
Mark (2013-11-01 12:44): i suppose it's the same for women too, because this all boils down to neediness 
Mark (2013-11-01 12:44): which is a subtle concept
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:45): Ehhh, I think it's way simpler for girls
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 12:46): Which is what amazes me about feminism and sexual liberation. They have been able to brainwash girls into going against a core evolutionary principle
Phillatio (2013-11-01 12:47) (2x <3): now all we have to do is exploit it
Mark (2013-11-01 12:48) (1x <3): feminism is a trade union for those whose SMV has crossed the line of no return
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 13:01): @Mark Well said
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 13:02) (1x <3): Feminism: Inadvertently recreating harems for alpha males since the 1960s
Phillatio (2013-11-01 13:25): ugh ltd
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 13:25) (2x <3): Uh oh... showdown in GayLife
Phillatio (2013-11-01 13:25): he's beyond help

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 14:58): @Mark Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 14:59): It's time for me to pull the plug, isn't it
Mark (2013-11-01 14:59) (1x <3): if you don't need to be in the office, come into the city
Mark (2013-11-01 15:00) (1x <3): i'm itching to get out
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 15:00): I need to be here to pretend that I'm working. I'll come out right after work
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 15:03): Time for me to check out of GayLife for a while
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 15:03): Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.
Mark (2013-11-01 15:27) (2x <3): i give up. no one is interested in theory in gaylife, it requires picking up a book
Mark (2013-11-01 15:28) (2x <3): Xander you must be really bored at work or something
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:02): A E does NOT love approaching. That is a dirty lie!
Nate (2013-11-01 16:03): Of course
Mark (2013-11-01 16:03) (1x <3): he's at the unconscious incompetence stage
Mark (2013-11-01 16:03): stage 1
Nate (2013-11-01 16:03): He's in love with his ignorance
Nate (2013-11-01 16:10) (1x <3): @Xander I thought you were going to tell Sanderp to get rid of that ridiculous profile icon
Mark (2013-11-01 16:10) (2x <3): poor AE's brain is going to explode if we go on any longer
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:12): I think I'm going to start speaking purely in platitudes
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:14): Sometimes I feel like GothamLife is really just a place for people to find new reasons to rationalize. It's like a gym for their hamsters
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:15) (1x <3): http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/7100000/Strong-Guinea-Pig-animal-humor-7187040-457-342.jpg

Nate (2013-11-01 16:26) (1x <3): Xander actually owes me money, but I'll make him make it up in random advice when he's not in the mood
Mark (2013-11-01 16:27): you've been wearing that devil outfit for too long Nate

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:28): Dana requested to be friends on Foursquare, so now I'm going to check in all over the city while I'm not contacting her
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:28): She has no idea how much it's going to backfire on her
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:28): "What, but he was in my neighborhood this night, why didn't he call me?"
Nate (2013-11-01 16:29) (1x <3): lol I've never seen someone so invested in manipulation
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:29): "Why is he going out so much? Is he already seeing other girls?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:29): @Nate You know, I learned all my best tricks from females
Nate (2013-11-01 16:29): Don't overdo it
Nate (2013-11-01 16:30): Yeah women are the best manipulators definitely
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:30): And since men are usually terrible at manipulating, I have plausible deniability
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:31): "Why are you so angry? I like having fun with my friends"
Nate (2013-11-01 16:32): I remember on a tv show recently someone said "We don't have to create a surveillance society, people are doing that to themselves."
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 16:51): What are closers doing this evening + weekend
Xander Xone (2013-11-01 16:52): Going hard

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 17:08): @Jimmyayo I'll join you.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 17:08): Instead of partying/drinking late at night hitting on girls just to be tired and useless the following day
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 17:09) (1x <3): Sweet.  I'll introduce u to some amazing cheapass food in chinatown.  If ur interested.

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 17:10): Just dig down deep within yourself, from the very bottom of your testicular reserves
Jimmyayo (2013-11-01 17:11): Bottom of the barrel sperm is what makes down syndrome #fact

Xander Xone (2013-11-01 17:18): @Mark So you took out your knife and plunged it into his spleen

Nate (2013-11-02 12:38): Even if you're gonna answer, always turn it back on her...
Nate (2013-11-02 12:38): "I never said sex was only the table, you move so quickly!"
Nate (2013-11-02 12:38): err on
Nate (2013-11-02 12:39) (1x <3): That comes out better in person tho
Nate (2013-11-02 12:39): Or am I right with that
Xander Xone (2013-11-02 13:21): I wouldn't even have acknowledged it
Nate (2013-11-02 13:30): Probably better
Marcus (2013-11-02 13:31): What is everyone doing tn
Xander Xone (2013-11-02 13:50): Fighting the Elite Four!
Nate (2013-11-02 13:50): Already?  Damn
Xander Xone (2013-11-02 13:54): Not yet, I lied
Nate (2013-11-02 13:55) (1x <3): cunt

Nate (2013-11-02 14:00): I got implants
Nate (2013-11-02 14:00): silicone baby, the ladies love it
Xander Xone (2013-11-02 14:00): Ah, you've upgraded from ping pong balls
Nate (2013-11-02 14:01): yeah they kept imploding
Nate (2013-11-02 14:50) (1x <3): Gonna go daygame in a few, any takers?

Nate (2013-11-02 15:30): k
D-money (2013-11-02 15:36): girl that hasnt been responding texted me today.. saying its a nice day out
D-money (2013-11-02 15:36): is she interested in a date or is this just charity for a bored girl?
D-money (2013-11-02 15:36): we made plans to go to central park soon
Nate (2013-11-02 15:37): Read the second and third lines, and find your answer
D-money (2013-11-02 15:37): dont get ti?
D-money (2013-11-02 15:38): you mean first and second?
Nate (2013-11-02 15:38): if she texted you, and then you made plans.
D-money (2013-11-02 15:38): maybe shes just lonely and bored
D-money (2013-11-02 15:38): i feel like some girls do that
D-money (2013-11-02 15:38): and im a really nice/harmless guy they think
Nate (2013-11-02 15:38): so what, keep texting her and then on a high note make plans
Nate (2013-11-02 15:39): yeah stop that.
D-money (2013-11-02 15:39): we already made plans
D-money (2013-11-02 15:39): lol
D-money (2013-11-02 15:39): going in like an hour.. but also sun will be down soon
D-money (2013-11-02 15:39): lol
Nate (2013-11-02 15:40): umm if she's going out with you in an hour, I need to smack you for asking this question
D-money (2013-11-02 15:40): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/7bae85402624013127167a552776a7b2

D-money (2013-11-02 15:41): damn it shes taking a bus
Nate (2013-11-02 15:42): so she's bored and texting you back plenty.  It's the perfect opportunity to build comfort/attraction with her
D-money (2013-11-02 15:43): ugh.. requires so much work.. i had 2 other more promising-looking ones i wanted to try to see today.. oh well
Nate (2013-11-02 15:58) (2x <3): yeah working for things sucks
Jimmyayo (2013-11-02 16:22): Hey natedawg won't be able to go out anytime soon, just learned I have a girl coming over
Jimmyayo (2013-11-02 16:23): My bads
Nate (2013-11-02 18:46): No biggie, met the other guys
D-money (2013-11-02 18:52) (1x <3): What do you do for a day 2 where you already fingered the girl and want to fuck, doesn't make sense to go to bar right?
Marcus (2013-11-02 18:57): Invite her to come cook with u @ ur place
Mark (2013-11-02 21:58) (5x <3): Rawr
D-money (2013-11-03 02:33) (2x <3): Fucked the girl from hallows eve
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:23): @Nate What ended up happening last night after I left?
Nate (2013-11-03 11:24): Not much, we played fifa and then departed.  Timex and Marcus went off towards the evillage and I went home
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:27): @Nate That's cool
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:27): My Tinder are starting to roll in
Nate (2013-11-03 11:29): What was the easy mode line you used before?  And exactly how did you say the "Tinder say you think I'm cute thing" ?
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:31): I think it was "Being me is like playing life on easy mode."
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:33): "Apparently, Tinder claims you think I'm cute. Is this true?
Nate (2013-11-03 11:33): Do you have any interests displayed on tinder?
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:34): Not really
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:34): I hardly have anything checked on Facebook
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:34): And I think that's were it pulls it from
Nate (2013-11-03 11:35): gratzi
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:42): np
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 11:47): I'm so hungry, but I don't wanna leave the apartment
Nate (2013-11-03 11:55): Hungry most accurately describes me right now
Nate (2013-11-03 12:27): it's cold as fuck outside
Mark (2013-11-03 12:28): Nate, meet in union sq at 2? maybe grab some grub
Mark (2013-11-03 12:29): good amount of sun today
Nate (2013-11-03 12:29): I can't I'm making breakfast right now, sry man
Mark (2013-11-03 12:30): no worries
Nate (2013-11-03 12:32): I got kinda a late start today :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 12:43): I'm still trying to get out of bed
Mark (2013-11-03 12:44): Xander pls
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 12:46): @Mark To be honest, I have been putting off a ton of errands for about two weeks because of my degeneracy
Mark (2013-11-03 12:53): that sounds like a cop out
Mark (2013-11-03 12:53): come out of a little bit, don't have to stay long
Mark (2013-11-03 12:53): for*
Mark (2013-11-03 12:54): do 1 approach and then you can leave
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 12:55): @Mark First I have to finish moving stuff from my other apartment whenever Ahmad feels like waking up
Jimmyayo (2013-11-03 13:14): Hey boys
Jimmyayo (2013-11-03 13:14): Imma head out to Chinatown soon
Mark (2013-11-03 13:39): http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pt4zj/ladies_of_reddit_whats_the_non_creepiest_way_i/
Mark (2013-11-03 13:40): loads of horrible advice
Nate (2013-11-03 13:40) (2x <3): Never ask a woman what works on a woman
Mark (2013-11-03 13:40): ^
Mark (2013-11-03 13:41) (1x <3): especially reddit women
Mark (2013-11-03 13:53): has to be non hostile setting. No random street approaches, on the train, etc. has to be in a store, Starbucks, somewhere she won't feel threatened or awkward.
Mark (2013-11-03 13:53): haha
Nate (2013-11-03 13:53): haha tell that to all the women I've banged/dated from street approaches
Jimmyayo (2013-11-03 13:54): obv those were sluts, not women
Nate (2013-11-03 13:54): of course
Jimmyayo (2013-11-03 13:55): a real woman would never welcome a conversation from a stranger
Mark (2013-11-03 13:55): god forbid you come off as a creep or nutjob
Mark (2013-11-03 13:55) (1x <3): random strangers' opinions of me mean so much
Mark (2013-11-03 13:57): "You're at a severe disadvantage to begin with because you're a stranger, and realistically speaking, there's a very low chance you're attractive/funny/charming enough to overcome that to begin with even for an average looking girl."
Jimmyayo (2013-11-03 13:57): holy shit...
Mark (2013-11-03 13:58): "Last week a guy approached me and asked if I was into butt fingering. Do not approach girls and ask them if they're into butt fingering."
Mark (2013-11-03 13:59) (2x <3): sounds like something i would do
Nate (2013-11-03 13:59): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/082c256026e80131304b1203282eef2b
Nate (2013-11-03 14:00): I was thinking of saying "We can have a drink before we get started at my place.  I have plenty of drinks there"
Nate (2013-11-03 14:00): Unless you think I should go
Mark (2013-11-03 14:01): what's the context
Mark (2013-11-03 14:01): that last text of yours was pretty risque
Mark (2013-11-03 14:01): if you can get away with that, might want to keep on push it further
Nate (2013-11-03 14:02): Well I said some other stuff like that before, and we've already slept together
Nate (2013-11-03 14:02): before that
Nate (2013-11-03 14:03): What do you mean by push it farther in this case?
Mark (2013-11-03 14:03): nvm thought you hadn't slept with her yet
Nate (2013-11-03 14:06): yeah slept with her, just trying to decide if I should accept her frame there.  I assume I shouldn't
Nate (2013-11-03 16:22): Question to texters.  I number closed a girl going to the store.  She was heading for food and then a dubstep concert.  When you text is your texting in that situation, would you ever ask how the concert went, or would you non-sequiter still
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:04): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/cf0f9e5027010131304b1203282eef2b
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:04): I would perhaps ask how it went AFTER some bullshitting
Nate (2013-11-03 17:05): cool
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:06): @Nate That almost seemed like a contro text
Nate (2013-11-03 17:06): which?
Nate (2013-11-03 17:06): the sexual one?
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:06): Yes
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:07): Asking a woman for advice on seducing women is like asking a fish how to catch fish
Nate (2013-11-03 17:07): Well I already slept with her, and said much worse in person.  
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:08): Yes, but that's in person
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:09): I tend to keep my dirty shit out of texting, except for some innuendo and lots of subtext. I save it for in-person
Nate (2013-11-03 17:10): I was inspired by GOL talking about threesomes.  If I blew this one I'm not too concerned tho.  Plenty of other choices.
Nate (2013-11-03 17:10): She did flake on me a bit later tho, so you're probably right
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:11): Hmm
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:11): Keep in mind that a lot of the shit GOL gets away with is because the girl is like 18
Nate (2013-11-03 17:15): I have blown it plenty of times before when I tried to get sexual too
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:15) (1x <3): Everyone in the other chat seems to be in favor of direct shit 100% of the time, but that's retarded
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:16): It's like dramatic tension
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:18): When you're being indirect and playful
Nate (2013-11-03 17:20): I'm guessing this was also too direct ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/18a9be7027040131a5de263b50cfd79d
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:20): An alpha grabs what's in front of him and takes it, he doesn't pine for it from afar
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:21) (1x <3): If she already knows what's in store for her (your dick) you don't need to beat her over the head with it. She's isn't a dude
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:21) (2x <3): You should, however, beat her over the head with your dick in person, later
Nate (2013-11-03 17:22): In the case above that's not true, different girl
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:23): I wouldn't even have sent that bikini line
Nate (2013-11-03 17:23): yeah, this is what I meant by having really bad instincts with texting
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:23): And I know you were trying to make it sound like you were a busy man, "My Tuesday is open right now" as in, "My Tuesday is open right now... but who knows if it still will be?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:24): But that's not the way it came across
Nate (2013-11-03 17:24): what should I have said?
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:24): @Nate Immediately start taking the lead
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:25): "Yes, taking you to ____"
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:25) (1x <3): lol, like you already had plans to take her there, she just didn't get the memo
Nate (2013-11-03 17:28): decided to take your advice even though it was triple texting...
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:28): AW SHIT
Nate (2013-11-03 17:28): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/30f8395027050131a21436d9a3bf1b5c
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:28): OH, BOB SAGET
Nate (2013-11-03 17:30): Despite myself I succeeded 
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:30): Good man
Nate (2013-11-03 17:31): I do think I might take a training with you at some point.  The important thing I need to learn which I do completely wrong, is when I send a text, what should I be thinking in terms of my goal and what I want to say in diff situations
Nate (2013-11-03 17:32): My instincts about what I should say are almost always wrong.  When I succeed in texting mostly its because of how well my in person reaction went.
Nate (2013-11-03 17:34) (1x <3): At least in this case I had the good sense to stop talking ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/110578e027060131a5de263b50cfd79d
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:36): Yeah. That last text wasn't great, but at least you didn't sink yourself like Ltd
Nate (2013-11-03 17:36) (1x <3): I wasn't kidding when I said I'm my own worst enemy texting.  Like I used to have with flirting.  I just 'don't get it'
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:38): Yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:38): It's kinda like that attempted number close at L'assio last night
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:39): I liked the persistence. You had the aggression part of the equation, but some of the playfulness and most of the wit were lacking
Nate (2013-11-03 17:39): Part of that was because I was kinda drunk.  Part of that is still my inexperience.
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:39): Yeah, I mean, we were all kinda drunk, haha
Nate (2013-11-03 17:40): :)
Nate (2013-11-03 17:40): I still have a lot of holes in my game.  My mid game still needs plenty of work.  I've done well recently because I'm no longer a train wreck, but I have illusions that I don't have a lot to work on
Nate (2013-11-03 17:41): err don't have illusions
Nate (2013-11-03 17:42): It wasn't that long ago that my interactions went about as well as Sandeeps
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:42): That's okay, you'll get there. You have the important parts
Nate (2013-11-03 17:43): I will get there, I don't think I'm hopeless anymore, just inexperienced
Nate (2013-11-03 17:44): I am kinda struggling right now with figuring out exactly what I should learn and practice to get there...
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 17:44) (2x <3): You can't teach aggression/persistence, except perhaps indirectly by demanding that someone start exercising to perhaps increase that shit through elevated testosterone levels
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 18:22): GothamLife 2.0 has been lost forever
D-money (2013-11-03 18:23): Fuck I get into this habit of paying for this bitch tha I'm not sleeping with
Nate (2013-11-03 18:27): Haha Xander. An argument over paying doesn't mean the end of them. :)
D-money (2013-11-03 18:27): I dot even pay for bitches that I sleep with!
Nate (2013-11-03 18:52): I love arguing both sides of an argument.  Sometimes that's half the fun.
Nate (2013-11-03 19:11) (1x <3): aaand she unflaked.  Bounce bounce
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 20:04): @Nate Yay!
Xander Xone (2013-11-03 21:31): She only had one picture... ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/13aa5d1027270131a6a73e283eb001f9

Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:06): Wait, Omar Mkumba from  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania?
Nate (2013-11-04 11:06): I feel like its either a Nigerian scam or a good way to get on a watch list
Nate (2013-11-04 11:07): doesn't say where he's from
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:07) (1x <3): Isn't that one guy's name om4r?

Nate (2013-11-04 11:08): How the fuck would he find me?  
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:09): It's not difficult...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:09): If you initiate a PM w/ someone via groupme it shows their account name.  For you I believe you set yours to your real name
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:09): Mister Nathan Ewing
Nate (2013-11-04 11:10): Didn't think I gave out my email or last name in that chat, maybe I did
Nate (2013-11-04 11:10): oh okay
Nate (2013-11-04 11:10): nvm then
Nate (2013-11-04 11:10): Well I'm not accepting facebook friend requests from that chat, especially for ppl I've never met
Nate (2013-11-04 11:10) (2x <3): Just seeing what contro posts is enough to convince me
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:10) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/957734e02799013184b40644b708c802

Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:11): ew
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:11): I have to hide that
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:11): seriously I vomited a little in my mouth 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:12): Well
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:12): Thank u for sharing...
Nate (2013-11-04 11:12): nsfl
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:12): nsfanything
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:13) (1x <3): had to share that was probably one of the most disgusting matches ever
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:14): When doing daygame, do you do anything to kinda psych yourself out a little bit prior to approaching?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:15): Maybe you give yourself a quick pep talk
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:15): Or skip/jump, 
Nate (2013-11-04 11:15): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3868c140279a0131a6224e56de7cf843
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:15): Something to get yourself into a fun, relaxed state?
Nate (2013-11-04 11:16): Is this a horrible profile pic?
Nate (2013-11-04 11:16): @jimmy I force myself to smile
Nate (2013-11-04 11:17) (1x <3): It's like a fake it till you make it, smile for a minute or so and you'll automatically feel happier
Nate (2013-11-04 11:18): If I'm in a really bad state I crank some energetic music, or just play it in my head
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:18): I don't smile, only frown, because I like working out my muscles
Marcus (2013-11-04 11:21): jmpromotion.com acpass.com
Nate (2013-11-04 11:21) (3x <3): Mostly though before when I had AA, I would just pick any girl whether I though they were particularly attractive and go talk to them.  I wouldn't be incredibly direct because I didn't like them that much, but I'd get talking to girls.
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:24): Damnit... now I can't run day game until next weekend
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:24) (1x <3): Geez those are all terrible clubs, w/ the exception of DL
Nate (2013-11-04 11:24): @Xander why?
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:24) (1x <3): @Nate it sort of looks like a selfie
Nate (2013-11-04 11:25): probably because it is one
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:25): lol yea you might want to get a pic of you doing something 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:25) (2x <3): Shouldn't online profile pics be of something you're doing that is a DHV?
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:25): yes ^
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:25) (2x <3): Or silly/funny/goofy
Nate (2013-11-04 11:25): hmm
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:25): @Nate Because I'm too irresponsible to wake up early enough to run day game before work, and the sun sets by the time I get out of work
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:26): yes to that too @Jimmyayo
Nate (2013-11-04 11:26): @Xander what does the sun have to do with day game?
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:26): Nothing, I'm just making up reasons
Nate (2013-11-04 11:26): yep
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:26): excuses*
Nate (2013-11-04 11:26) (1x <3): If it motivates you, you sound like LTD Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:26): That's true
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:26) (1x <3): I'm basically a big bitch
Nate (2013-11-04 11:27) (2x <3): Xander Xone has changed his name to Xander Bitch
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:27): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:27) (1x <3): didn't ltd do something like that
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:27): You're rationalizing
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:27): he was like chump ltd or some shit
Nate (2013-11-04 11:27): @Phil that's what I just said
Nate (2013-11-04 11:27): oh okay
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:27): oh..
Nate (2013-11-04 11:28) (1x <3): I meant he was a chump, not his name :)
Nate (2013-11-04 11:29): hmm, I don't know how to take a funny/silly/goofy photo that still looks good
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:29): Yeah, I'm having a bad week, mentally speaking
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:29): Rationalize = rational lies
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:31): NATE
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:31) (2x <3): You should take one of you shooting pool, as you're cueing up
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:32) (2x <3): You get to stick your ass out and look all sexy like
Nate (2013-11-04 11:33) (2x <3): This is what most of my silly photos look like 😁 ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d01a4d80279c0131faea56127945aa69
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:33): YES!
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:34): I say make that your profile pic
TiMex (2013-11-04 11:34): Haha nice
Nate (2013-11-04 11:34): okay :0
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:35): Guys... I'm ready to resign from Closers. I have lost it. May a more able man replace me
Nate (2013-11-04 11:35) (1x <3): I should find that pic of me wearing a tshirt on my head on a mountain climb too
Nate (2013-11-04 11:35): @Xander melodromatic
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:36): Xander Xone
"Guys... I'm ready to resign from Closers. I have lost it. May a more able man replace me"

Sigh...ok someone bring in Sandeep
Nate (2013-11-04 11:36): hahaha!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:36) (3x <3): The pupil has become the master
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:37): Maybe I shouldn't skip breakfast 100% of the time. I think I get weepy when my blood sugar is low
Nate (2013-11-04 11:37): @Xander I got flaked on 6 times last week.  If anyone earns the lameness crown recently it's me
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:44) (1x <3): hey Xander want a job
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:44) (1x <3): at my company
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:44) (1x <3): cause I could probably get you one
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:44) (1x <3): we're hiring 
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:46): @Phillatio Yes, yes I do
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:47): I'm terrible at programming though
Nate (2013-11-04 11:47): @Xander what is it exactly that you do?
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:47) (1x <3): @Nate I jerk off all day
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:47) (1x <3): that's okay you'll have to know enough to pass the interview but I'll coach you on what they're gonna ask
Phillatio (2013-11-04 11:48): its fairly easy
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:48) (2x <3): @Nate Into a paper cup, then I throw it at passersby
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:50): I bullshit around with Android (Java), and sometimes I make sales calls
Nate (2013-11-04 11:51): I'm doing my performance appraisal, let the bullshit flow
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 11:52): Whaddya mean
Nate (2013-11-04 11:52) (2x <3): Once a year or so I have to justify my job by saying how awesome I am, then my boss tells me how he agrees
Nate (2013-11-04 11:53): Since noone I work for actually pays attention at all to what I'm working on, this is not difficult
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 11:54) (2x <3): Man I could reallygo for some pho or ramen today
Nate (2013-11-04 11:55): Sounds yummy
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:01): @Jimmyayo Check me in on foursquare if you go
Nate (2013-11-04 12:02) (1x <3): @Jimmy, check Xander in at a Male Strip club, std clinic, and police station
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:03): Yeah, because I forgot to last time I was at those places
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 12:03) (1x <3): that reminds me. how was phd xander?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 12:03): ;)
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:03): This plan of mine is backfiring
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:04): She checked in at The Raines Law Room at like 2:00 in the morning last night
Nate (2013-11-04 12:04): Is that even open at 2am?
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:04): I was literally just checking that now
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:05): Looks like it closes at 2
Nate (2013-11-04 12:06): She's definitely testing you, that's a date spot
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:07): Yeah, no shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:08): That was also following a check in at Birreria a few hours earlier
Nate (2013-11-04 12:09) (1x <3): You guys have more stamina for games than I would
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:10): Fuck it, I'm gonna call her

Nate (2013-11-04 12:10): @Mark for me?  You shouldn't have
Mark (2013-11-04 12:11): why do i attract all the horses on okc
Nate (2013-11-04 12:11): The better question is how can I
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:12): Perhaps we have differing definitions of what "horse woman" means
Mark (2013-11-04 12:13) (1x <3): i'd be ok with motorboating that though
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:13) (1x <3): Alright, I'm putting this bullshit out of my mind for tonight. I must concentrate on coital consummation with this black chick
Nate (2013-11-04 12:14): Seeing Wawa tomorrow.  I'll try not to laugh at her name.

Nate (2013-11-04 12:17): There is quite a bit of sexual subtext in that one.  I bet she's really fun in the sack
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:18): @Nate Don't forget the big smackers too
Nate (2013-11-04 12:18): hellz yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 12:20): Is that a joke on the U of Phoenix thing?
Mark (2013-11-04 12:22): i was hoping the mlp thing was a joke
Mark (2013-11-04 12:22): but nope
Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:22) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/a33a41f027a30131a6224e56de7cf843

Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:25): she sent me a message
Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:26): probably should respond
Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:27): it says I respond selectively to messages on my profile 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-04 12:27): Only if you want to meet her one day ;)
Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:27): or 'very selectively' rather
Phillatio (2013-11-04 12:27) (1x <3): that's some DHV shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 12:32): I'm pretty sure that GothamLife has become 95% Gangster of Love wack off

Marcus (2013-11-04 13:38): @nate is this you? "There hasn't been a week this month where I haven't had at least 3 dates with different women, and sometimes it's as many as 6 in a week. I can get numbers with practically no effort now during the day. At least half the time I go on a first date now I end up taking the girl back to my apartment too. I can't believe how much different it feels to have abundance!"
Nate (2013-11-04 13:39) (2x <3): Umm yes it is...
Mark (2013-11-04 13:40): lol
Nate (2013-11-04 13:40): I hope they didn't use my name
Mark (2013-11-04 13:40): for real
Nate (2013-11-04 13:40): That was my status email
Mark (2013-11-04 13:41): good testimonial
Marcus (2013-11-04 13:41): no they didnt use ur name
Nate (2013-11-04 13:44): Yeah my testimonial certainly can't hurt them :)
Mark (2013-11-04 13:45) (1x <3): wonder if you're their biggest success story
Nate (2013-11-04 13:46): I hope not
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 13:46): Most guys end up going omega prime
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 13:46): Following their workshops
Mark (2013-11-04 13:46) (1x <3): bad news for phil

Xander Xone (2013-11-04 14:00): @Mark Thank you for that
Mark (2013-11-04 14:01): really subtle brag
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 14:01): I bet his frame would be really easy to break

Mark (2013-11-04 14:58) (1x <3): to use as leverage
Nate (2013-11-04 14:58): I realized that this weekend had both one of the best and one of the worst pua moments of my life

Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:00): Damnit, I'm second-guessing the calling her. I think it's a bad idea now
Mark (2013-11-04 15:00) (1x <3): do. not. call.
Mark (2013-11-04 15:00): like, ever.
Mark (2013-11-04 15:00): until you've banged at least
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:01) (1x <3): You know why? I asked my friend Erin if I should call her and she said, "Yeah, totally!" or something along those lines. That's when I knew I should do the exact opposite
Mark (2013-11-04 15:02): calling is too large of an investment this early on
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:02): Truly. I'm going to stick with my plan and check in at my date spot tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:02): @Phillatio I'm actually going uptown, so no Solas reunion

Nate (2013-11-04 15:07): would still bang
Mark (2013-11-04 15:08) (1x <3): i think i'm more attracted to the guy on the right
Mark (2013-11-04 15:08) (1x <3): i'm not gay though
Mark (2013-11-04 15:08): :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:09): ‏@LawDogger5h

Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:21) (1x <3): The problem is, tinder is a crutch for me. I can get at least two dates a week with decent girls through tinder, so I'm thinking about casting it aside to force myself to get better at daygame

Marcus (2013-11-04 15:22): R we having a meetup sometime this week.

Mark (2013-11-04 15:23) (2x <3): although at this rate, i won't need a suit
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:23) (1x <3): @Mark Soon, you won't even need the fat suit

Marcus (2013-11-04 15:57): I think this will get lots of hits
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:57): @Mark You know what would be better, just hand over $50 or $100 at the start of the day game session
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:58): So that the loss is inevitable, but you have to work toward gaining it back
Mark (2013-11-04 15:58) (1x <3): but do you have that much in your account
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 15:58) (1x <3): Sandeep says... Yes!

Marcus (2013-11-04 16:00): I like this. I think we should do money approaches
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:00): @Mark And I'm going to hold you close and never let go
Mark (2013-11-04 16:00): did you want me to shove you into random girls on the sidewalk again or did that not help
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:00): I should probably be the one tackling them myself
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:01): a la fat suit faceplant style
Mark (2013-11-04 16:02): i remember finding a wooden crutch on the sidewalk this one night and walking around with it
Mark (2013-11-04 16:02): everyone would get out of my way, it was awesome
Nate (2013-11-04 16:03) (1x <3): I remember walking down the street with a big scythe.  Same feeling ;)
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:03): Once we get good enough at this, we're going to start needing handicaps: "Excuse me, I have gonorrhea"
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:07) (1x <3): "Hey, you with the tits!"
Mark (2013-11-04 16:08): i'm a romantic at heart
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:10) (1x <3): I wonder if this chick tonight eats curry fried chicken
Mark (2013-11-04 16:18): I wonder what her snatch smells like
Phillatio (2013-11-04 16:19) (1x <3): idk about you guys but I love the smell of vagina
Phillatio (2013-11-04 16:20): not too smelly but lightly scented 
Phillatio (2013-11-04 16:20): its weird when it smells like nothing
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:22): I mostly love the smell of vagina, but if you've smelled a foul snatch before, that smell never leaves you
Mark (2013-11-04 16:26): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DSTZbS6LvA

Nate (2013-11-04 16:29): shes overweight, but not horribly shaped
Phillatio (2013-11-04 16:30): idk 
Phillatio (2013-11-04 16:30): WNB

Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:38): But that .5 seems to make a big difference
Nate (2013-11-04 16:38) (2x <3): Main difference is kitty knows how to asian up with makeup
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 16:39): I'm going to asian up for you tonight, Nate

Nate (2013-11-04 18:08): No wonder
Nate (2013-11-04 18:08): I may stupid shit, but at least I don't make girls skin crawl
Nate (2013-11-04 18:09): Sandeep, continuing to say things that reinforce his child molester image :(
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 18:09): I have a feeling that this is going to be an interesting night
Nate (2013-11-04 18:09): @X why did she text you a naked pic?
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 18:12) (2x <3): @Nate Nope. I just sense fortuitous events headed this way
Phillatio (2013-11-04 18:13): they're probably just headed my way
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 18:14) (2x <3): @Phillatio That's just my flatulence

Marcus (2013-11-04 19:15): I really feel like testing it out
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:16) (1x <3): via @heartiste If a girl mentions another man, hold up your hand & say "You hear that?" "What?" "The sound of this conversation dying." #YourDailyGame
Nate (2013-11-04 19:27) (1x <3): In a world, where Nate watches 3 hours of honest trailers
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:28) (1x <3): This summer, one man...one mission
Nate (2013-11-04 19:29): To waste as much time as possible

Nate (2013-11-04 19:42): haha
Nate (2013-11-04 19:42): I did
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:42): 18.   What sort of trouble are you causing?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:43): omg i cant believe i used to use these verbatin
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:43): ok, i'll paste 3 more
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:43): 27.   What are you doing……besides missing me and
doodling hearts on a piece of paper? ;)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:43): Nate I cant copy/paste anymore these are too painful
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:44): I yield to the text diety, XanderXone
Nate (2013-11-04 19:44): lol
Nate (2013-11-04 19:44): I've used some of these before
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:44): lol oh yeah, i kept them all on an email chain i'd refer to.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:44): 51 Rock-Solid Openers for only $1.99
Nate (2013-11-04 19:46): I realized as I was whining that I already did one "In a world, where one man watches 3 hours of honest trailers on youtube"
Nate (2013-11-04 19:46): so I sent that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:46): oh shit
Nate (2013-11-04 19:48): is that your reaction to my text or the pasting of openers :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:48): lolll
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:48): my reaction to your text
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:48): its more like a "Oh shit, it's on Nate."
Nate (2013-11-04 19:48): haha
Nate (2013-11-04 19:49): if it works I'm reusing that as my next ping text
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:50): Even though I sucked at opening on Saturday, I was basically walking around muttering like 100 different openers
Nate (2013-11-04 19:50): yes, you have more AA than sandeep does
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:51): @Nate I'm going to stab you and play with your blood
Nate (2013-11-04 19:51): The hate, it feeds me
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:52): Did you know that I'm utterly insane?
Nate (2013-11-04 19:52): I do, but I'm sadistic
Nate (2013-11-04 19:52): also masochistic

Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:54): I guess?
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:54): Lol I'm confused
Nate (2013-11-04 19:54): Um or the girl you push into a corner
Nate (2013-11-04 19:54): Ask her if she's high
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:55): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ee37eb9027e201316ab70ae1b91fe1fb
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:55): I felt like that was appropriate
Xander Xone (2013-11-04 19:56) (1x <3): The only thing that's gonna be waiting for you is my dick
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-04 19:56) (1x <3): she sounds like a grade a bitch
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:56): Lmao
Nate (2013-11-04 19:56): She's getting awefully demanding for a first date
Marcus (2013-11-04 19:56): I think she is leading u into buying her a drink
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:57) (2x <3): It's not gonna happen
Nate (2013-11-04 19:58) (1x <3): I'm leaning towards Xander's idea now of hatefucking her
Phillatio (2013-11-04 19:58): Every bitch wants to have a more alpha guy to lead her and deny her bitchy bullshit
Nate (2013-11-04 19:59): "I got you the best dirty glass of water money can buy"
Marcus (2013-11-04 20:00): Have a water waiting 4 her lols
Marcus (2013-11-04 20:00): Xander u still @ work

Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:06) (1x <3): We had an hour long conversation about how I should have paid for her drinks
Mark (2013-11-05 00:06): like for real or jokingly
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:06): is this the brunette wench u posted earlier?
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:07): Yes @pippy and it was for real she was offended
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:07): lol man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:07): well
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:07) (2x <3): lets chalk one up for the good guys
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:08) (1x <3): http://img.pandawhale.com/54546-Cheers-Toast-gif-OLQT.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 00:08): @Phil
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:08): I still like her actually she was pretty and funny and we got along fairly well
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:08): I'll probably go out with her again
Mark (2013-11-05 00:08) (2x <3): well a good way to get around that one is to buy the first round, and get her to buy the second
Mark (2013-11-05 00:09) (1x <3): less awkwardness
Mark (2013-11-05 00:09) (1x <3): vs splitting 50/50
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:09): Yeah idk it was awkward no matter what
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:09): We kissed anyway
Mark (2013-11-05 00:10): atta boy
Phillatio (2013-11-05 00:10): Just a small one
Mark (2013-11-05 00:11) (2x <3): i told Xander to rub that indian's lady's tits
Mark (2013-11-05 00:12): and smell her vag
Mark (2013-11-05 00:12): hope he took my advice
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 00:47): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/a474a420280b013184b40644b708c802
Marcus (2013-11-05 08:53) (1x <3): I feel like im being followed @xander
Nate (2013-11-05 08:55): she definitely knows the game she's playing too
Nate (2013-11-05 08:57) (3x <3): He's gonna marry that girl, they are made for each other
Mark (2013-11-05 09:47): i'd respond with a one word answer like 'fun' or 'bueno'
Mark (2013-11-05 09:48): it's just basic game, nothing too crazy
Nate (2013-11-05 09:50): I can see Xander is taking from the Kitty Sun school of texting :)
Mark (2013-11-05 09:51): speaking of Kitty, she pinged me again last night
Mark (2013-11-05 09:51): 'Hi'
Mark (2013-11-05 09:51): not very creative is she
Nate (2013-11-05 09:52): Probably because I saw her for the last time last night and kicked her out when she said she wanted a boyfriend.  
Mark (2013-11-05 09:52): ohhh
Nate (2013-11-05 09:52): Wait I mean Sunday
Nate (2013-11-05 09:52): last night no
Nate (2013-11-05 09:53): Got the asian/black chick tonight
Mark (2013-11-05 09:53): did you go yaya on wawa
Nate (2013-11-05 09:53): She's been texting me ever since saying she doesn't want to lose touch with me
Nate (2013-11-05 09:54): Wawa is tonight
Mark (2013-11-05 09:54): so... wawa is also asian/black?!
Nate (2013-11-05 09:54): Time to get some better chicks and stop being lazy
Nate (2013-11-05 09:54): yeah
Mark (2013-11-05 09:54): damn son
Mark (2013-11-05 09:55): didn't even know there were that many out there
Nate (2013-11-05 09:55): There aren't
Mark (2013-11-05 09:56) (1x <3): GOL using gaylife to promote his services... it has begun: "For those of you that have been messaging me about coaching, I probably don't be starting again until after finals(beginning of Dec.) if I do I will give notice"
Nate (2013-11-05 09:57): That's not any different than before, only difference is he's posting more of his texts
Nate (2013-11-05 09:57): This summer he and his bro were promoting all the time
Mark (2013-11-05 09:57): and now with MTB gone, there's no resistance 
Nate (2013-11-05 09:58): To be honest I don't think it's a bad thing.  His texts will motivate people more than grundle boy would.  If he actually helps people more it'll probably be worth his ads
Mark (2013-11-05 09:58): i wish he explained more of the concepts rather than showboat 
Mark (2013-11-05 09:58): because you can't just emulate some other dude's vibe
Mark (2013-11-05 09:59) (1x <3): he did a bit of that today though, have to give him credit
Mark (2013-11-05 09:59) (1x <3): although fairly basic frame control stuff
Nate (2013-11-05 10:00) (1x <3): It's hard to explain something properly when you're far more advanced, but I'll push him to explain more
Mark (2013-11-05 10:01) (1x <3): good practitioners don't always make good teachers
Nate (2013-11-05 10:01): agreed
Nate (2013-11-05 10:02): Since we all moved here tho, there are very few advanced people posting there, so I still see this as good.  People will ask questions.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:13): Honestly, gol is alright in my book
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:14): he is a bit showoffy and maybe uses the chat selfservingly from time to time, but I don't think he abuses it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:14): and is certainly way less obnoxious about it than his brother was, saying "I'm so proud of youuuuu!" to anybody that made an approach
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:15): he has good advice that helps a lot of the members, he's adding value
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:16): sure he can be a dick once in a while, but I don't care abiut that
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:19): sorry for not jumping on the wagon
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:20) (2x <3): Anyways, for Thursday how bout we skip the churrascaria and do something a bit more budget conscious?  Dropping $90 for a casual midweek dinner is a bit much
Nate (2013-11-05 10:20) (1x <3): @jimmy I'm not one of the ones that dislikes gol.  He has his moments, but he's always treated me well
Nate (2013-11-05 10:21): Okay if you want cheap+good how about midweek dimsum in chinatown
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:23): That sounds p good
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:23): Have u guys had Saigon Grill? By Union Square
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:24): I recommend that as well
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:24) (1x <3): Or fucking 5 for $1 dumplings
Nate (2013-11-05 10:25): Haha that's a little too budget for dinner :)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:29): yeah
Nate (2013-11-05 10:29): Great dumplings tho
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:29) (1x <3): There's also Mighty Quinn's BBQ in EV
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:29) (2x <3): Fucking fantastic (just don't get the wings)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30): Oh gu7us
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30): guys
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30): guise
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30) (1x <3): So I took the free Intro to Improv class last night
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30): It was fun
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:30): And
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:31): Terrifying
Phillatio (2013-11-05 10:32): awesome
Phillatio (2013-11-05 10:32): I wanna do that 
Mark (2013-11-05 10:32): yeah i'm take one of those after my current class ends
Nate (2013-11-05 10:32): Mables Smokehouae in wburg is also fantastic
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:35): I was surprised at how much I was in my own head
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:36): There were close to 20 ppl there last night, but most of them seemed to be in some kind of creative/performing arts field 
Nate (2013-11-05 10:36): Jimmy you accurately described improv.
Nate (2013-11-05 10:36): Fun and terrifying

Nate (2013-11-05 10:38): Also the pit is close to where we live
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:38): They have a great show Friday nights there @ Magnet theater, it's a pretty hilarious concept.  The audience members write down some deep secret, or something they want to get off their chest.  Then the performs choose one of those notes and that becomes the opening line for that act
Nate (2013-11-05 10:40): That's basic long form with some flair added :)
Phillatio (2013-11-05 10:44): so did you get up and improv @jimmyayo

Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:47): I'm gonna try to check out an improv show tonight
Nate (2013-11-05 10:49): Upright Citizens Brigade.  The classes are awesome, but take effort to get into cause they fill up fast
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 10:50): Yeah they seem to be the big name in town
Nate (2013-11-05 10:51): Because they are awesome

"@Sandeep, right now, knowing you, the answer to 'should I fuck her' should always be yes"
Nate (2013-11-05 11:49): Tough love.  He's always looking for excuses not to be successful
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 11:49): Fuck, I definitely need to rejoin GayLife

Xander Xone (2013-11-05 13:22): Lol, read that earlier pippy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 13:22): The last 2 paragraphs in the article are the only 2 that really matter...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 13:23) (1x <3): What
 a lot of guys don't realize is that the power that comes from being 
attractive comes more from the internal things you develop by being 
attractive (confidence, charisma, boldness etc) and not physical 
attributes. I know guys with average looks who get with more girls 
than me, or are more captivating speakers, or more popular. I didn't 
have to work at any of those things, but guys who did and did it well 
can often do it better.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 13:23): It's
 harder for women - but the average guy has a lot of latitude in how he 
becomes 'attractive.' Make a lot of money, sign up for Trunk Club, wear 
shoes that make you taller, get in shape, slow down your movements and speech, and I guarantee you'll get 80%+ to where I am.
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 13:23): I have the perfect response, Mark

-Lil Wayne
Mark (2013-11-05 15:48): Xander's gone off the deep end

Phillatio (2013-11-05 15:59): lol me too
Phillatio (2013-11-05 15:59): she won't go out with me
Nate (2013-11-05 15:59): Why?
Phillatio (2013-11-05 15:59): no idea
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 15:59): Excellent way to punish her
Nate (2013-11-05 16:00): Well send me her link, I'll give it a shot
Nate (2013-11-05 16:00): :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:02) (1x <3): I'm just turning into a giant troll ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8d749040288b0131db9106dc010d3e56

Nate (2013-11-05 16:03): What a crock, lol
Mark (2013-11-05 16:03): ruh roh
Nate (2013-11-05 16:04): That was the chick I number closed in the park with you guys
Nate (2013-11-05 16:04): Thinking of saying something like  "3 weeks.  I won't remember what you look like by then"
Nate (2013-11-05 16:05): Open to suggestions
Mark (2013-11-05 16:05): which park
Nate (2013-11-05 16:05): We were only in 1 park
Mark (2013-11-05 16:05): which day though
Nate (2013-11-05 16:05): Saturday
Mark (2013-11-05 16:06): oh
Mark (2013-11-05 16:06): was it the one you ran after
Nate (2013-11-05 16:06): yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:07): "You're a fox. Let's bang :) I'm Jon"
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:07): suddenly I feel pretty good about my messages
Nate (2013-11-05 16:07): haha
Mark (2013-11-05 16:07): that's why i did that experiment
Nate (2013-11-05 16:08): Any idea what I should reply to 3 week chick?
Mark (2013-11-05 16:08): most msgs were so douchey
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:09): most messages I get are pretty shitty too 
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:09): "hey" or "hey there" or "hey handsome" and of course they look like a troll
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:09): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/7f0d0460288c013199973af121b48efa
Mark (2013-11-05 16:10): can you post the whole thing Nate
Nate (2013-11-05 16:10): There's not much else there, except my bad texts
Nate (2013-11-05 16:11): One saying nice to meet you.  One saying lets get a drink monday because I'm busy this week after that because of my friend
Mark (2013-11-05 16:11): where does the i have a bf thing come from then
Nate (2013-11-05 16:11): She mentioned it when I first met her, and then immediately said we should have a drink though
Mark (2013-11-05 16:12): ohh
Nate (2013-11-05 16:12): I think
Nate (2013-11-05 16:12): Trying hard to remember :)
Mark (2013-11-05 16:13): why does her last text just end abruptly
Mark (2013-11-05 16:13): o nvm it's backwards
Nate (2013-11-05 16:13): Texts sometimes come in backwards for me
Mark (2013-11-05 16:15): why does it seem like GOL has beef with Xander
Nate (2013-11-05 16:16): I don't particularly care about this chick, but I'm curious what can be done from an educational perspective
Mark (2013-11-05 16:16): i'm confused
Mark (2013-11-05 16:17): you should go riskier
Nate (2013-11-05 16:17): How riskier?
Mark (2013-11-05 16:18): well usually i would just match her investment level, which is pretty low here
Mark (2013-11-05 16:18): but you could really push for a meet
Mark (2013-11-05 16:18): since she's already a sunk cost
Nate (2013-11-05 16:19): I feel like immediately countering with a push for a meet would seem desperate
Mark (2013-11-05 16:19): well it's high risk/high reward imo
Mark (2013-11-05 16:20): sounds like she really does have a bf, but isn't satisfied
Mark (2013-11-05 16:20): not sure what the vibe was in person
Nate (2013-11-05 16:21): That was the vibe
Nate (2013-11-05 16:21): You mean something like "Haha that's cute.  Tomorrow night works.  8pm sharp.  We'll meet in front of the Whole Foods in Union Square"
Mark (2013-11-05 16:23) (1x <3): a little less, maybe 'you know what goes well with a hard day's work? a drink'
Nate (2013-11-05 16:25): done
Nate (2013-11-05 16:26): I genuinely wish I could sample the brain thoughts of how you think in these situations
Mark (2013-11-05 16:27): you could've led with 'same here. i'm super busy around holiday season. but you know what goes well...' 
Nate (2013-11-05 16:27): too late
Mark (2013-11-05 16:28): yeah i know, just for discussion purposes
Nate (2013-11-05 16:28): yeah that makes sense
Mark (2013-11-05 16:29): i think the optimal strategy is to always mirror her investment level, and use that as a baseline
Mark (2013-11-05 16:29): and then using that reference level, modulate your investment level from slightly under to slightly over
Mark (2013-11-05 16:30): so if her investment level is set at 50, you should try to shoot for 45, then 55 briefly, then back to 45
Mark (2013-11-05 16:30): it's hard to completely quantify this, but that's my current mental model
Mark (2013-11-05 16:31): and i'm sure the model will change over time
Nate (2013-11-05 16:31): Makes sense, although recognizing that in practical use aint ez
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:32): I wonder if I should kick GOL's ass at the meetup
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:32): I would love to do that 
Nate (2013-11-05 16:32) (1x <3): you are a bundle of joy today Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:33): Yeah, I'm kinda grumpy
Mark (2013-11-05 16:33): i can totally imagine that happening
Nate (2013-11-05 16:33): It's that time of the month
Mark (2013-11-05 16:33) (3x <3): with Sandeep crying in the corner
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:33): I love how he couldn't stand the tension
Mark (2013-11-05 16:33) (3x <3): god what a vagina
Nate (2013-11-05 16:34): I see him as a little girl at this point.
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:34): That's what the beta mind is: feminine
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:35): I'm rejoining I can't be left out of all the fun
Nate (2013-11-05 16:35): hmm I need a band to listen to, EDM or other electronic.  My internet radio is crapping out.
Mark (2013-11-05 16:36): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92MXaZJNjUc
Phillatio (2013-11-05 16:36): listen to some swedish house mafia 
Mark (2013-11-05 16:36): i'm listening to that right now
Nate (2013-11-05 16:36): and now I am too
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:37): Last night, I had a dream about you
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:37): In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
Mark (2013-11-05 16:37): that's one of their best songs
Mark (2013-11-05 16:38): i want to use the lyrics as street openers
Nate (2013-11-05 16:39): "One more time, we're gonna celebrate"

Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:43): circle jerkey
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:44): I'm gonna open with Daft Punk lines tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:45): "If you lose your way tonight, that's how you know the magic's right"
Nate (2013-11-05 16:45) (2x <3): That would work on me
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:46) (1x <3): I know, because it did
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 16:46) (1x <3): Sweetcheeks
Mark (2013-11-05 16:55): fml it's all dark and shit outside
Mark (2013-11-05 16:55): i need a hug
Nate (2013-11-05 16:55) (2x <3): Walk outside, go up to the first girl you see, and say exactly that
Mark (2013-11-05 16:56): that would require going outside
Mark (2013-11-05 16:57) (1x <3): i'll say it to the cleaning lady
Nate (2013-11-05 16:58) (1x <3): Every time I see Sandeep's profile pics I wanna punch him

Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:08): margherita 
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:08): oh no
Mark (2013-11-05 17:09): maybe she's just a normal money grubbing italian slut
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:09): I want a margerita
Mark (2013-11-05 17:09): that would make sense
Mark (2013-11-05 17:10): i like how her profile says 'most of my model friends like to date other models, but not me, nope, i like to slum it'
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:11): incomming @Nate
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:19): okay GOL has been removed from my shit list
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:19): he may be a dick but he's not as big of a dick as his brother
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:20): I'm about to crack and text Dana
Nate (2013-11-05 17:23): Ecstatic was never a dick.  He was doing that to try and be supportive
Mark (2013-11-05 17:23): don't you fucking do it
Mark (2013-11-05 17:23): Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:24): Oh, what's the use?
Mark (2013-11-05 17:24): i will return melee if you text her
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:24): When do I get to text her
Nate (2013-11-05 17:25): Normally I'd say text the bitch
Mark (2013-11-05 17:25): did you respond to her last one yet
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:25): No
Nate (2013-11-05 17:25): But right now I'd say text her when you're not feeling like the crap on my shoe
Mark (2013-11-05 17:26): well, you can text her in that case
Mark (2013-11-05 17:26): what did she say again
Mark (2013-11-05 17:26): 'how's 4square' or some bullshit?
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:26): http://i.groupme.com/a474a420280b013184b40644b708c802
Mark (2013-11-05 17:27) (1x <3): i'd go with 'c'est bon'
Mark (2013-11-05 17:27): or something of that nature
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:28): I don't feel like answering it
Nate (2013-11-05 17:28) (2x <3): yes you do, lying bitch
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:28): I feel like writing something, I don't feel like answering her stupid question
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:29): then don't
Mark (2013-11-05 17:30): problem is, it'll be hard to keep it short and low investment and change the conversational thread at the same time
Mark (2013-11-05 17:30): but i'm sure you'll figure it out
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:30) (1x <3): lol, "Mostly"
Nate (2013-11-05 17:31) (1x <3): the irony being that neither of them is actually low investment
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:31) (1x <3): "Tonight"
Mark (2013-11-05 17:32) (1x <3): the more you think about it, the more you're going to be invested naturally
Mark (2013-11-05 17:32) (1x <3): she's occupying too much of your mental real estate
Mark (2013-11-05 17:32) (1x <3): that's the root of the issue
Nate (2013-11-05 17:33): How long has it been since you've seen her?
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:33): Uhhh, last Tuesday
Nate (2013-11-05 17:34): Bah, see the woman before you go more insane than you already are
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:34): She's getting there
Mark (2013-11-05 17:35) (2x <3): don't you love these staring contests
Mark (2013-11-05 17:35): or at least, i like to watch others have them 
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:35): She just wants me to caveman her the next time I see her
Nate (2013-11-05 17:36): Caveman is good for all occasions
Mark (2013-11-05 17:36): y'know as uncomfortable as it may be, tension is a good thing
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:36): That's true, but she's practically had a forcefield up until this point
Mark (2013-11-05 17:36): if you're thinking about caving, then you're pretty much Sandeep
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:37): Not if I rape her
Mark (2013-11-05 17:37): not if i get there first
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:38): Well, don't be surprised if I miss and accidentally hit your bunghole instead
Mark (2013-11-05 17:39) (1x <3): and don't be surprised if your cock gets ground to dust after all those glute exercises i've been doing
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:39): Ass kegels
Mark (2013-11-05 17:39): now i'm kegeling, thanks a lot jerk
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:40): helps if you have premature ejaculation..
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:40): if you get good at them you can hold orgasm off indefinitely
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:40): or give yourself multiple orgasms
Mark (2013-11-05 17:41) (2x <3): i probably shouldn't google kegel literature at work
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:43): I can't think of a single reason not to text her right now
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:44) (1x <3): I should fraudulently check in at the closest bar to her apartment
Mark (2013-11-05 17:47): RIP Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:48) (2x <3): Fuck this, I'm gonna go play Pokemon
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:48): that's the spirit
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:49): I'll just never text her again
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:49): See what happens
Nate (2013-11-05 17:51): Don't do that, you like her.  That's retarded
Nate (2013-11-05 17:51): Course you won't do that, you're just having pms
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:51) (1x <3): he won't he's just be melodramatic 
Nate (2013-11-05 17:51): yeah I know
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:51): as usual
Nate (2013-11-05 17:51): I just like calling him retarded
Phillatio (2013-11-05 17:51): lol 
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 17:54): lol, next text "I'm in a lot of trouble"

Mark (2013-11-05 18:00): a good photographer can work magic
Mark (2013-11-05 18:00): not to say she isn't hot
Mark (2013-11-05 18:00): need to see more photos
Marcus (2013-11-05 18:00) (3x <3): She sucks at making websites
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:01): pretty much
Mark (2013-11-05 18:01): her blog has like no design sense
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:01) (2x <3): I'm sure she has been getting the pussy pass
Mark (2013-11-05 18:03) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/63e406a0289c0131420522000aef140c
Mark (2013-11-05 18:03): this chick better not be a man, i swear
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:03) (1x <3): She's lesbianese!?
Mark (2013-11-05 18:03) (1x <3): she's a milkshake
Mark (2013-11-05 18:03): italian name though
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:04) (1x <3): lebanese omg
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:04) (1x <3): she's purrrfect
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:04): You should make her a milkshake
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:04): ... with your jizz.
Mark (2013-11-05 18:04) (1x <3): oh right, Phil is lebanese sorta
Mark (2013-11-05 18:04): totally forgot
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:04): I thought Phil was klingon
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:05): I'm half and half
Mark (2013-11-05 18:05) (3x <3): he looks more like a na'vi to me
Mark (2013-11-05 18:06): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/e4152af0289c0131420522000aef140c
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:07): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:07) (1x <3): Comparable to the number of daygame approaches that Nate does in an 8 hour period
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:07): "Message storage: 498 of 5000"
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:07): 300 of those are from the past two days
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:08): they send you those "it's a match" messages
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:08) (1x <3): and since I did the swipe right for everyone
Mark (2013-11-05 18:08) (1x <3): it's retarded because i can't for the life of me find hot girls using my filter, but they always seem to find me
Mark (2013-11-05 18:09) (1x <3): oh btw Phil, a neat trick is to update your profile frequently so you get bumped up
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:09) (1x <3): I'm going to switch careers to bartender so that I can do daygame every day
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:09): thanks @Mark
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:09): @Mark Is that OKCupid Local you're talking about?
Marcus (2013-11-05 18:09): Also another neat trick is to always be online
Mark (2013-11-05 18:10): no i don't use locals
Mark (2013-11-05 18:10): just plain old messaging back and forth
Mark (2013-11-05 18:10): but i have a bot that spams a bunch of people everyday
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:11): oh I was doing the locals thing
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:11): but then I message them normaly
Mark (2013-11-05 18:12): don't have much experience with locals, but it looks like a tinder copycat
Marcus (2013-11-05 18:18): U have a bot
Mark (2013-11-05 18:20): bot? sorry i meant to say 'boy'
Mark (2013-11-05 18:20): one of my many cousins
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:20): Ah yes, Filipino no doubt
Mark (2013-11-05 18:20): something like that
Mark (2013-11-05 18:21): better i don't know so i don't get attached
Mark (2013-11-05 18:21): when he dies from malnourishment
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:22): His name was Antonio, Mark. You could have saved him
Phillatio (2013-11-05 18:23): his name was robert paulson 
Mark (2013-11-05 18:25): filipino, not mediterranean 
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:25) (1x <3): His name was Nathan Ewing
Mark (2013-11-05 18:26): not my fault he doesn't like the taste of gruel
Nate (2013-11-05 18:26) (1x <3): All mourn the loss of Nathan Ewing
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:26): Pray for him, my brothers
Mark (2013-11-05 18:27): damn
Mark (2013-11-05 18:27): he hasn't died yet, relax
Mark (2013-11-05 18:27): give it another week or so
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:28): He died on the way to Wawa to get his frozen coca cola
Mark (2013-11-05 18:28) (2x <3): while Nate died on his way in to Wawa
Nate (2013-11-05 18:29): This game is never dull

Xander Xone (2013-11-05 18:46): Damnit, that was my last ditch effort to avoid having to go out tonight
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 19:53): @Mark
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-05 19:54) (1x <3): just read u rope-a-dope that OkCupid check and then on the phone.  That was solid

Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:01): its on
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:01): What do I do now
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:01): keep ignoring her
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:01) (1x <3): lol idk maybe not 
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:06): Dude... ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4c998f5028be0131420522000aef140c
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:06): damn she's hooked
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:06): keep it oging
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:06): you're on a streek
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:07): No man, this isn't right
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:07): well talk to her then give her a bit of pull
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:07): She just tipped her hand
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:08): I just don't know how to respond to it
Mark (2013-11-05 22:08) (1x <3): nice win
Mark (2013-11-05 22:08) (1x <3): she gave in first
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:09): I'm at a loss for what to say now
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:09): I'm never at a loss for words
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:09) (2x <3): give her a bit of beta
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:10): That may very well be the correct path
Mark (2013-11-05 22:10) (1x <3): 'been busy lately. miss me?'
Mark (2013-11-05 22:11): a bit risky
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:11): Haha "I'm no good for you, Dana"
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:11) (1x <3): Faux beta badboy
Mark (2013-11-05 22:11): you could call her and schedule a date
Mark (2013-11-05 22:12): better able to read if she's really upset or just play upset
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:12): I think she's actually upset
Mark (2013-11-05 22:12): yeah sounds like it
Mark (2013-11-05 22:12) (1x <3): what a baby
Mark (2013-11-05 22:12) (2x <3): she played with fire and got sent to the burn ward
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:14): LOL
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:17): Is this a vindication of Game?
Mark (2013-11-05 22:18) (1x <3): all part of the mating dance my friend
Mark (2013-11-05 22:18): i'd give her a quick call if i were you, you're guaranteed to secure a date from that
Mark (2013-11-05 22:19): either way, you should be able to convert this into a date
Mark (2013-11-05 22:19): texting is a bit more risky though because she's emotional and it'll be harder to read her
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:21): The whole being busy thing doesn't work that well with all of the foursquare checking in I've been doing
Mark (2013-11-05 22:21): who says busy has to equate to work
Mark (2013-11-05 22:22): but i get what you're saying... you can rephrase it into something like 'things have been hectic lately' or w/e
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:24) (1x <3): Just called and left a voicemail since she didn't pick up. JESUS
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:24): fuck why wouldn't she pick up
Mark (2013-11-05 22:25) (1x <3): oh... you should've txt her first
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:25): that's anonying
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:25): Whoops
Mark (2013-11-05 22:25): 'calling you in 5min. pick up.'
Mark (2013-11-05 22:25): oh well
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:25) (1x <3): Looks like this chapter of my life is over
Mark (2013-11-05 22:25): what was the voicemail
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:26): Something stupid, like "Hey, it's Xander. Give me a call back whenever you get this. Later"
Mark (2013-11-05 22:27): not the end of the world
Mark (2013-11-05 22:28) (1x <3): she might've been taking a shit for all we know
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:28): I thought it was at the very least neutral aa
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:28): -aa
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:31): Oh well. Guess I don't send her a text too
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:33): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0fc5c24028c20131b8c912313b12cc51
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:33): aw she's sweet
Mark (2013-11-05 22:33): see
Mark (2013-11-05 22:33): all worked out
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:34) (2x <3): NAH, WE GON TALK TONIGHT BITCH
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:35): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/798cd98028c20131420522000aef140c
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:36): WYB? been talking to this hoe on okc
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:36): Should I tell her to call me back when she's done
Mark (2013-11-05 22:37) (1x <3): no need to rush it
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:37): that ^
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:38): I mean should I even send her surgery message
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:38) (1x <3): I was thinking something, if anything, along the lines of "free later"
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:38): or "I'm free later"
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:39): also its not clear if your asking or telling when you say that which is good
Mark (2013-11-05 22:40): calling tomorrow has the main benefit of not breaking the tension entirely
Mark (2013-11-05 22:40): you give her the opportunity to spend all night thinking about you
Mark (2013-11-05 22:41): and the anticipation of expecting your call tomorrow will keep you in her thoughts as well
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:41): yeah mark is right
Mark (2013-11-05 22:41): like if you call in the afternoon, she will be thinking about it all morning
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:41): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/44497cc028c30131b8c912313b12cc51
Mark (2013-11-05 22:42): aw you gave in
Mark (2013-11-05 22:43): i'd respond with 'i'll explain later'
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:43): K
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:43): I kinda was thinking "What do you think"
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:44): mmmm don't say that
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:44) (1x <3): I'll explain later is good because now she'll want to call you 
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:45): to find out
Mark (2013-11-05 22:45): yep
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:45): That's what I said
Mark (2013-11-05 22:45): 'what do you think' isn't bad, but it'll probably just confuse her
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:45): We'll see what happens
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 22:47): Heh, "I'll explain later" is probably going to make her sick in the pit of her stomach
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:48) (1x <3): hopefully she finishes dinner faster
Nate (2013-11-05 22:48): Just finished my date
Phillatio (2013-11-05 22:48): how'd it go Nate
Nate (2013-11-05 22:49) (1x <3): Fun girl, got her back to my place.  I think we both escalated a little too fast and she got lmr and left.  She was diving on top of me.
Nate (2013-11-05 22:49): Will see again
Nate (2013-11-05 22:50) (2x <3): Part of that was her fault, she got me so horny I seriously could not think straight.  I lost control.
Mark (2013-11-05 22:54): happens to the best of us
Mark (2013-11-05 22:54): especially if drinking is involved
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:00): I just want to go to sleep when I drink these days
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:00): She called me back. Told me to set up a date someone this week
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:00): *sometime
Mark (2013-11-05 23:00): she told you? lol
Mark (2013-11-05 23:00): this girl
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:01): I mean, not like that
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:01): I asked her, and she said to let me know when I was thinking because she was going to sleep
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:01): She sounded like she was falling asleep on the phone
Mark (2013-11-05 23:01): hopefully she remembers the conversation in the morning
Nate (2013-11-05 23:02) (2x <3): Sounds like a good sign tho Xander
Nate (2013-11-05 23:03): This night really reminded me of the difference between wanting to sleep with someone and having explosive chemistry
Mark (2013-11-05 23:04): yeah it's pretty clear Xander dominated this particular battle
Nate (2013-11-05 23:04): This girl had a body that would make a rap star jealous
Nate (2013-11-05 23:04): Yeah he did
Mark (2013-11-05 23:04) (1x <3): i told you those days of agony would pay off
Mark (2013-11-05 23:04): can't be the one to blink first
Nate (2013-11-05 23:05): Lesson I still haven't learned well.  What do you recommend is the best alpha male reading?
Mark (2013-11-05 23:05) (2x <3): but yeah Nate i feel ya... some girls you have a primal connection with, and others you have to intellectualize your desire for them
Nate (2013-11-05 23:06): This was seriously primal, and she felt it too.  Usually I make out for 20 mins or so at least before I push farther, and this time we were just all over each other.
Mark (2013-11-05 23:08) (1x <3): as far as reading goes, i hate to use this term, but read something that's 'cocky funny'
Mark (2013-11-05 23:08): tucker max comes to mind, there are plenty of others
Nate (2013-11-05 23:09): God, I still have no blood to my brain and I fapped one out too
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:17): That's the thing... I feel intellectual and carnal attraction to Dana. That's why I'm having so much trouble thinking straight
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:19): This is all bad
Nate (2013-11-05 23:19): No, it's actually pretty good
Mark (2013-11-05 23:19) (1x <3): aw someone's in luuuve
Phillatio (2013-11-05 23:20): yeah you sort of love her
Phillatio (2013-11-05 23:20): joking aside 
Nate (2013-11-05 23:20): It may be a bit scary for ya, but it's really a good thing.  It's not easy to find that kind of connect
Phillatio (2013-11-05 23:21): I'm jelly Xander
Mark (2013-11-05 23:22): she is pretty cute for a jewish chick, gotta admit
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:22): Hahaha
Mark (2013-11-05 23:22): and not too much of that jewish princess syndrome
Mark (2013-11-05 23:22): ok, maybe just a little
Nate (2013-11-05 23:22): just sounds like she's got fire
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:24) (1x <3): I'm still laughing about Nate being like "No wonder he likes her. She's like Xander with tits"
Mark (2013-11-05 23:26) (3x <3): nah, she's way better looking than you
Nate (2013-11-05 23:48): way to give away the other chats existence jimmy
Mark (2013-11-05 23:49): epic fail
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:50): We've been compromised. Disperse!
Mark (2013-11-05 23:50): *disperses*
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 23:51): I'm durnk sryz
Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 23:51): lol

Jimmyayo (2013-11-05 23:52): obv she's not very invested
Xander Xone (2013-11-05 23:54): You're tending toward high-energy and reactive in that text, Jimmy
Nate (2013-11-05 23:56): we need to say something to throw off the other chat
Mark (2013-11-05 23:57) (2x <3): w/e doubt anyone cares
Nate (2013-11-05 23:57): true, just don't want to entertain the questions
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 00:32): I'm sure that some suspect its existence merely from our reduced traffic
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 08:51): Not helpinggg
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 10:00): Hate waking up still drunk from the prev night
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 10:00): yeah the next day is a complete throwaway

Mark (2013-11-06 10:19): that's better
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 10:19): Jesus, what a manly man

Mark (2013-11-06 13:11): not as good
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 13:11): Fuck, maybe we should do our meetup at Noodle Village then
Mark (2013-11-06 13:12): aha
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 13:24): Gonna daygame a bit

Xander Xone (2013-11-06 13:53) (1x <3): At both ends
Nate (2013-11-06 14:37): The difference between japanese and chinese cultures...
Nate (2013-11-06 14:37) (2x <3): Japanese: Hello, welcome.  Please be seated.  How may we help you <bows>
Nate (2013-11-06 14:37) (2x <3): Chinese: <Doesn't turn around to you> What you want?
Mark (2013-11-06 14:44) (1x <3): you mean the difference between cheap and expensive restaurants
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 14:45): lolllllllll
Nate (2013-11-06 14:45): I've never run into a rude japanese restaurant
Mark (2013-11-06 14:45) (1x <3): what you don't realize is that it's all chinese folks anyhow
Mark (2013-11-06 14:46) (1x <3): unless it's like Nobu or something
Nate (2013-11-06 14:46): of course, it wouldn't be a blatant generalization if I didn't include all of them

Nate (2013-11-06 14:52) (1x <3): They have any kinda dumpling you want as long as it's pork
Nate (2013-11-06 14:53): Good stuff
Nate (2013-11-06 14:53): That whole tray there was $3.00
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 14:53): yeah, relatively cheap hole-in-the-wall

Xander Xone (2013-11-06 14:55): Those look filled with poo
Mark (2013-11-06 14:55): 10/10 would eat again
Nate (2013-11-06 14:56) (1x <3): probably because they are boiled

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:02): Nice work Jimmy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:03): anything interesting happen with these girls in terms of the game u ran
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:03): other than being ridiculously good looking today?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:03): Whew what an adrenaline rush
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:03): Love it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:04): Artsy chick already texted: " I'm free tomorrow or Friday during the day if you wanted to grab a cheap bite to eat er something!"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:04) (1x <3): Her texts suck, she needs a lesson from xander

Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:07): @Pippy I feel like I'm working my way back up w/ daygame since I've regressed so much...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:08): I went in w/ high energy for sure
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:08): yeah man, do share
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:08): Since they were all moving sets, I needed to make sure they'd STOP and TALK to me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:08): I think a lot of what prompted me to jump off the diving board was hearing the minute-by-minute breakdowns from you and others
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:08): Without making them feel stuck or trapped...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:09): I walked around for 30 min being such a fucking pussy
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:10): Gave myself a quick pep talk for a min...then just went after the hottest girls I saw 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:10): love it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:10): @Jimmy @Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:10): what do u feel is the best way to stop the target during day game
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:10): realtalk
Nate (2013-11-06 15:10): @jimmy what opener you use?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:10): I watched a B&C video recently that said that if a girl isn't stopping for you, your energy isn't high enough
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:10): That's alright. I was the biggest pussy ever this past Saturday
Mark (2013-11-06 15:11): all you have to do is stop
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:11): 



  
Jimmyayo

  

  

  
  

  I watched a B&C video recently that said that if a girl isn't stopping for you, your energy isn't high enough
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:11): You're not committed enough to the approach, kinda half assing it
Nate (2013-11-06 15:11) (1x <3): @pippy the best way to stop a girl is to walk right past her turn towards her, and say excuse me, loudly
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:11): One thing that may help, is legit acting like she has to stop and listen.  Like if you're legit late for a n important meeting and u need to get directions, how much more does that energy come across because u know that person needs to fucking stop and give directions
Nate (2013-11-06 15:11) (1x <3): and stop walking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:11) (1x <3): ive noticed same kind of thing.  If you know where you're going and ask for directions, energy isnt htere
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:12): Noted, good stuff Nate
Nate (2013-11-06 15:12): I literally never get a girl not stop at this point 
Mark (2013-11-06 15:12): getting them to stick around is another story
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:12): I don't think you necessarily need to be high energy... do you?
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:12): Just... forceful
Mark (2013-11-06 15:12) (1x <3): that requires conversational skills
Nate (2013-11-06 15:12) (2x <3): Although I have started having an issue that I do the same opener too much, it's starting to feel forced
Mark (2013-11-06 15:13): high energy is more nightgame stuff
Nate (2013-11-06 15:13): High energy helps a lot
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:13): @Nate, i heard about same issue before
Mark (2013-11-06 15:13) (1x <3): i think there's a difference between high energy and high conviction
Mark (2013-11-06 15:14) (1x <3): besides, they never ever remember the opener
Mark (2013-11-06 15:14): it's the conversation that's the meat
Mark (2013-11-06 15:14): but yeah Nate, i've stopped doing the same canned opener lately
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:14): That's the thing about canned openers...
Mark (2013-11-06 15:15): the opener is a good place to demonstrate social intelligence by calling out the elephant in the room
Nate (2013-11-06 15:15): that's not necessarily true.  If you really nail the opener they will remember it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:15) (1x <3): U can start sounding like a robot, or almost coming across _too_ smooth
Mark (2013-11-06 15:15): or just lacking in social intelligence
Nate (2013-11-06 15:15): yeah I've started having that problem lately
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:15): alright
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:16) (2x <3): so, i think we all know the Ben & Charlie daygame opener (also known as LoveSystems Soul)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:16): what else is good then
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:16): i think the structure of that is solid. 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:16): that indirect stuff feels like a cop-out
Mark (2013-11-06 15:16): behavioral psychologists have figured out that people only remember the beginning, peak, and end of an experience
Nate (2013-11-06 15:16): indirect isn't good
Mark (2013-11-06 15:16): so nail those pieces and you're good
Nate (2013-11-06 15:16): you say plenty of things tho
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:17): Wait wait
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:17): Indirect definitely has its place in the game bros
Mark (2013-11-06 15:17): indirect is just slower, can be good for beginners
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:17): Jimmy, do share
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:17) (1x <3): Indirect is better for inside business establishments
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:17): indirect = "Hey what time is it", "Where is xyz" "What is the best xyz around here"
Mark (2013-11-06 15:17): and a good gamer can transition from indirect to direct after reading her cues
Nate (2013-11-06 15:18): indirect has the disadvantage that if you don't go direct fairly soon, you can get stuck talking to a girl who has a boyfriend/husband and isn't interested in straying
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:18): The transition is the critical piece 
Mark (2013-11-06 15:18): all you need to say is 'i really came here because...'
Nate (2013-11-06 15:18): yeah
Nate (2013-11-06 15:18): well no mark
Nate (2013-11-06 15:18): the problem with that is then you seem insincere and sneaky
Mark (2013-11-06 15:19): depends on the delivery
Nate (2013-11-06 15:19): you can just change the subject to a compliment
Mark (2013-11-06 15:19): you can preface it with 'i have a confession to make'
Mark (2013-11-06 15:19): or 'i lied'
Mark (2013-11-06 15:19): 'i really came here to tell you...'
Nate (2013-11-06 15:19): blah blah book, blah, you know, I have to say, you look gorgeous in that dress
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:19): http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/noted-ryan-the-office.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:19): go on
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:20): I don't know why I'm anxious about daygame approaches, since I'm a conversational god
Mark (2013-11-06 15:20): well no that would be awkward lol
Nate (2013-11-06 15:20): Not how I deliver it
Mark (2013-11-06 15:20): oh nvm misread that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:20): Xander Xone
I don't know why I'm anxious about daygame approaches, since I'm a conversational god
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:20): Straight up, daygame is anxiety inducing like whoa. 
Nate (2013-11-06 15:21): @Xander you're comparing yourself to me, and thinking "Man I'll never be as good as Nate"
Mark (2013-11-06 15:21): but yeah you're just having a conversation... the approach isn't the hardest part by far
Nate (2013-11-06 15:21): for the approach is the easiest part, the conversation is harder
Mark (2013-11-06 15:22): and the thing with this is that it's way too easy to see it as something that's easy
Mark (2013-11-06 15:22): due to all the marketing or success stories
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:22): I know that I'll get there, it's just nauseating
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:22): Like being at the starting line of a 400 meter race
Mark (2013-11-06 15:22): it's all due to this i think http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic
Mark (2013-11-06 15:22): few people ever have videos or stories about their failures
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:22): Xander, it may help to realize that u may have to do 30 approaches to even get a number
Mark (2013-11-06 15:22): so they don't get an accurate distribution of outcomes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:23): ur first 30 i mean
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:23): kinda takes the pressure off when u know that for x amount, its really just practice
Mark (2013-11-06 15:23): it won't take him that many
Nate (2013-11-06 15:23): Well people think they can do 5 approaches and suddenly be a god at this
Mark (2013-11-06 15:23) (1x <3): girls have already been throwing their panties at him on the street
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:23): Looks like I may have a date tmrw w artsy fartsy hipster ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3d518cd0294f0131a94322000ae848a8
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:24): Yeah, see... I'm used to like doing 3 approaches and getting a number at night
Mark (2013-11-06 15:24) (1x <3): if xander doesn't get a number this sat, chipotle for all
Mark (2013-11-06 15:24): on the house
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:25) (1x <3): Opener (in Unforgivable voice): "GIMME YOUR NUMBER"
Nate (2013-11-06 15:25): @Xander I did 4 approaches and got nothing on the way to lunch
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:25): "... BITCH"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:26): yeah i mean, i was hearing success stories from some guys who got into daygame this summer
Nate (2013-11-06 15:26): Usually I have to do on average around 4 approaches to get a number, sometimes better, sometimes much much worse
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:26): and they would say how they sucked for first 30, managed to get number after 50, instadate after 75
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:26): i think it  takes the pressure off a bit.  To have midnset of "Okay, i will fail 30 times but no big deal"
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:26): I honestly don't think it will take that long
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:26): cool man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:26): but even if it does, it may remove pressure and help u keep forging ahead
Mark (2013-11-06 15:27) (2x <3): 1000 appraoches is the magic number
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:27): I learned that from winnnnnnnnnnnn
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:27): Nate
Usually I have to do on average around 4 approaches to get a number, sometimes better, sometimes much much worse
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:27): Nice man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:27): @Mark, why do u think 1000 is
Mark (2013-11-06 15:27) (2x <3): winnn doesn't approach, he just randomly jabs his dick into things
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:28): Hahahahaha
Mark (2013-11-06 15:28) (1x <3): 1000 is when you get a grasp on the true distribution of outcomes
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:28): I want that guy at my parties
Mark (2013-11-06 15:28): if you do 10 a day, that's only 3-4 months
Nate (2013-11-06 15:28) (1x <3): My problem now isn't the numbers, it's converting the really hot ones into dates
Mark (2013-11-06 15:28): realistically, doing 5/day will take half a year or so
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:29): @Mark, understood thanks for clarifying.  I've heard similar, wanted ur POV
Mark (2013-11-06 15:29): not that long of a time if you think about it
Nate (2013-11-06 15:29): 5/day is easy.  You can do 5 in 20 minutes if they don't all go well
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:29): Nate, how many have u done
Mark (2013-11-06 15:29): yeah the problem is if they go well 
Mark (2013-11-06 15:29): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:30): what was ur progress like at first
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:30): i remember u saying u felt a bit hopeless at first
Nate (2013-11-06 15:30): That's not so much a problem...
Mark (2013-11-06 15:31): i already get to work late
Mark (2013-11-06 15:32) (1x <3): nate has done at least a billion of them
Nate (2013-11-06 15:32): @pippy I have no idea how many I've done now.  ALOT
Nate (2013-11-06 15:33): In the beginning I did horribly due to bad body language, facials, voice tone, etc
Nate (2013-11-06 15:33): Then after that it was conversation skills
Nate (2013-11-06 15:33): Now they are good enough that I can convert some to dates, but not good enough to convert the really hot ones
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:34) (1x <3): Start grabbing asses
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:35): yeah thanks Nate, i think the impressive aspect is the amount of work u put in to get to a level of just basic competence
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:35): not even a light at the endof the tunnel really, u kept plowing
Nate (2013-11-06 15:36): @pippy I started off much worse than most people did, so I had a much bigger hole to dig out of
Mark (2013-11-06 15:36): it's a long road, people who expect it to happen overnight are deluded, i was one of them not too long ago
Nate (2013-11-06 15:36): I'd say at this point you're right, I have basic competence
Nate (2013-11-06 15:37): I fully expect it will be at least another couple years of real work before I can get advanced
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:37): Mark, what was ur process like
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:37): I'm an omega
Nate (2013-11-06 15:37): your a snuffleupugus
Mark (2013-11-06 15:37): i bought into the marketing bullshit and thought it was easier than it is
Mark (2013-11-06 15:38): basically the first step is getting her to stop, getting her attention
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:38): i hear that, did u start at an extreme deficiency
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:38): or were u more less socially "there"
Mark (2013-11-06 15:38): well i'd say i started off with decent social intelligence
Nate (2013-11-06 15:38): Mark started off as the asian urkel
Mark (2013-11-06 15:39): yeah i had to leave the calculator and pocket protector at home
Mark (2013-11-06 15:40): also helps being tall lol but that has nothing to do with me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:40): it seems that the greatest turnarounds are ones where there was a strong emotional impetus to get started
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:40): i find that the guys who did okay but still go head-first into pickup to be a diff breed
Mark (2013-11-06 15:40): you kinda need to hit some sort of metaphorical bottom
Mark (2013-11-06 15:40): to get your ass in gear
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:41): http://www.returnofkings.com/20834/22-signs-hes-a-player
Mark (2013-11-06 15:41): for me, i broke off a 4yr relationship
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:41): yep, there it is lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:41): the need to never let a breakup hurt u like that again
Mark (2013-11-06 15:41) (1x <3): oh no i was so fucking happy it ended
Mark (2013-11-06 15:41): but my game was rusty as hell
Nate (2013-11-06 15:41): For me I realized I was going to never get laid again if I didn't plow through like crazy
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:41): The need to get higher quality vag
Mark (2013-11-06 15:42) (2x <3): the biggest motivation was like Xander said, i thought i could do better
Mark (2013-11-06 15:42): and i wanted to realize my market value
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:42): yep 
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:42): same here
Mark (2013-11-06 15:42) (1x <3): but knew that id have to put in effort to get there
Mark (2013-11-06 15:43) (1x <3): most guys are content with settling
Mark (2013-11-06 15:43) (1x <3): but i'm not
Mark (2013-11-06 15:43): part of that is living in nyc i suspect, you really see what's out there
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:44): I'm glad most guys feel like settling 
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:44): I was meant for big things
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:44): more for the rest of us
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:45): I was born to step on the average Joe
Nate (2013-11-06 15:45): I was born to be a god
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:49): I was born to spread my genetic material to the most genetically perfect female I can attract
Mark (2013-11-06 15:49): *females
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:50) (1x <3): Phil's beta-ness rears its ugly head!
Phillatio (2013-11-06 15:50): lol I want to get married and have kids eventually
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:50) (1x <3): GAY
Mark (2013-11-06 15:51) (4x <3): says the guy who wants to marry Dana
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:51): She's just my beard
Nate (2013-11-06 15:52): yeah you do want to wear her on your face
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:53): I don't know if I can bring myself to see her this week after gaining 30lbs
Nate (2013-11-06 15:53) (1x <3): less whining, more fucking her
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 15:54): Aw shit, those stars are piling up
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:55): Man...why is it that chicks you've already fucked seem so uninteresting?  
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 15:55): there is a reason for that
Mark (2013-11-06 15:55): men are programmed to spread their relish
Nate (2013-11-06 15:56): Yeah that's easy, I realized I didn't care about them at all beyond fucking them
Nate (2013-11-06 15:56): I still call up chicks I've fucked, but only when I'm not getting fucked by new ones
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:56): Girl 1 - super hot body, toned, abs, dresses slutty for you, fucks you whenever you want.  You've fucked a few times, she wants to see you more.
Girl 2 - not quite as hot as Girl 1 but still def cute, has maybe passing interest in you. 

In this scenario, I get all worked up over Girl 2
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:57): And end up completely neglecting Girl 1
Mark (2013-11-06 15:57): that's the dark side of game, the more apathy you have towards pussy, the more pussy you get... but on the flip side, the less rewarding pussy becomes
Nate (2013-11-06 15:58): I guess I'm not there yet.  I still feel great fucking girls I've fucked, just not as great as ones I haven't
Mark (2013-11-06 15:59): it's a gradual process, but yeah that's the extreme end of the spectrum
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:59): But why am I chasing girls that are less aesthetically pleasing than girls I'm already seeing
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:59): I don't understand myself 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:59): TELL ME WHY
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 15:59): AIN'T NUTHIN BUT A HEARTACHE
Mark (2013-11-06 15:59): everyone loves a challenge
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:00): Not me
Mark (2013-11-06 16:01): stfu youre the biggest tease of all
Mark (2013-11-06 16:01): i buy you chipotle and you wont let me put itt in
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:01): Those burritos are kinda big...
Mark (2013-11-06 16:01): i had lube with me
Mark (2013-11-06 16:02): a bottle of smokey tabasco 
Mark (2013-11-06 16:15) (1x <3): i love how contro tries to join the conversation and always manages to make it awkward
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:15) (1x <3): Here cum the comments
Mark (2013-11-06 16:15): stop encouraging him xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:16): No, I don't believe I shall stop
Nate (2013-11-06 16:16) (1x <3): Well whereas with Sandeep I think pedophile, with contro I think he'll be in jail for rape at some point...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 16:16): lollllllll
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 16:16): not only one that gets bothered when people unnecessarily spell cum, esp out of context
Mark (2013-11-06 16:17) (2x <3): "Wait winnnn is black ? I thought he was a human ?"
Mark (2013-11-06 16:17): loooool
Nate (2013-11-06 16:18): LOL that is the most racist thing I've ever heard
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 16:18): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-06 16:18): no context that sentence is hilarious
Phillatio (2013-11-06 16:18): its pretty close
Phillatio (2013-11-06 16:20): the context did not make it better
Nate (2013-11-06 16:27) (2x <3): @Xander started reading krauserpua from the beginning, great stuff so far.
Mark (2013-11-06 16:28) (1x <3): i like the random porn on his blog
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:28) (1x <3): The only thing random is your parents being allowed to get green cards
Mark (2013-11-06 16:29): who said anything about green cards
Nate (2013-11-06 16:30): hmm he recommended reading the conan stories, I'm gonna do that
Mark (2013-11-06 16:37) (1x <3): http://ak3.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/0x98/684x782/0/14582691846235424431.jpeg
Mark (2013-11-06 16:37): if she had better teeth, she'd be totally doable
Mark (2013-11-06 16:37): what a shame
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:40): You don't like the gummy looks?
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:40): *look
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:40): But that's like... 50% of azn girls
Mark (2013-11-06 16:41): that's why i don't date asian girls
Mark (2013-11-06 16:41): although i like it when they take out their dentures
Mark (2013-11-06 16:41): and blow me
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:41): WHAT YOU WANT
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 16:41): CHICK FLY LICE?
Mark (2013-11-06 16:42): with extra msg pls

Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 17:07): Gentlemans
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 17:07) (1x <3): Are we doing this tmrw?  For reals
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 17:08): We could to East Village or Chinatown, both have cheap ass food
Nate (2013-11-06 17:10) (1x <3): always love when my food comes with ass

Xander Xone (2013-11-06 17:17): He has a date

Xander Xone (2013-11-06 17:18): I don't curr
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 17:18): even though it would be better for me too

Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 17:21) (1x <3): Awesome, looking forward to it.  First *official* closers meetup 
Mark (2013-11-06 18:25) (1x <3): http://i.imgur.com/qS07lFo.jpg
Phillatio (2013-11-06 18:49): lmao
Phillatio (2013-11-06 18:49): that's definitely something I would do
Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:03) (1x <3): so I just got this message on my okc "I'd like to blow you"
Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:04) (1x <3): its a tranny lol 
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 19:04): Fat chick?
Xander Xone (2013-11-06 19:13): You need to be a little more open-minded @Phil
Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:14) (1x <3): I'm gonna let him/her suck my dick
Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:33) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/1f884cc029720131a94222000ae848a8

Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:34): hahaha
Phillatio (2013-11-06 19:34): I'm gonna see how far I can take this
Marcus (2013-11-06 20:03): Interesting
Jimmyayo (2013-11-06 21:37): Good work Phil sex with women is so 90s
Phillatio (2013-11-06 21:51): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/737c12b029850131420a22000aef140c
Phillatio (2013-11-06 21:52): I'm wondering if I could have handled this better
Mark (2013-11-06 22:24): Nice phil
Mark (2013-11-06 22:24): You learn fast
Phillatio (2013-11-06 23:08): I learned from the best
Phillatio (2013-11-06 23:45) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/52a42d8029950131420a22000aef140c
Phillatio (2013-11-06 23:46): Lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 10:14) (1x <3): Gangster of Love
It's honestly pretty cool how hard I owned some girls recently
Like I even impressed myself
Phillatio (2013-11-07 10:27): So modest
Nate (2013-11-07 10:37): I realized how different this world is from reality when it was talking to my friend about what I'm doing
Mark (2013-11-07 10:45) (3x <3): What is real?   How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 10:46) (1x <3): Stop trying to hit me and hit me!
Nate (2013-11-07 10:51): He was sort of in shock when I talked about some of my recent exploits
Nate (2013-11-07 10:51) (1x <3): Said "no girl who doesn't sleep with a lot of guys would sleep with you in the first couple dates", hahaha
Mark (2013-11-07 10:52): you must free his mind
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 10:53) (1x <3): You can only show him the door. He's the one who has to walk through it.
Nate (2013-11-07 10:55): I know it wouldn't be very kosher, but I was wondering what you thought if I brought him and an omega friend of his with me to the dinner tonight...
Nate (2013-11-07 10:56): Feel free to say yes or no without consequence
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 10:59): Hidden camera, anyone? http://www.woot.com/offers/gear-pro-720p-hd-sport-action-cam-4?utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_campaign=aeb9f770ed-Daily+Digest+-+20131107+-+Woot&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c5ca76da11-aeb9f770ed-294470725
Mark (2013-11-07 10:59): i want to do approaches with google glass
Mark (2013-11-07 10:59): and analyze them after
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:03): I don't feel too strongly either way @ Nate...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:03): But slight preference to keep it a Closed meeting, if you will
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:03): HA
Nate (2013-11-07 11:03): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:03): http://i.imgur.com/mmysBYq.jpg
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:04): You could make them wait outside, like dogs
Nate (2013-11-07 11:04): I'll meet up with them after dinner
Nate (2013-11-07 11:05): yeah if anyone needed pua it's this omega kid.  Sooo bad.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:06): Question for you guys:

Do you feel more attractive after 1) big lifts and bulking, or 2) cutting and getting vascular?
Nate (2013-11-07 11:06) (1x <3): big lifts, my testosterone levels go through the roof
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:07): Obviously big lifts. I ain't no metro
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:09): I know this can sound gheyz, but you never get a little self conscious after bulking? If ur eating the recommended amt, you'll be putting on a little pudge along w/ the muscle
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:10): http://i.imgur.com/NYfTAG0.jpg
Nate (2013-11-07 11:10): I have a little pudge right now, girls don't seem to care
Mark (2013-11-07 11:11): they did this scientific study
Mark (2013-11-07 11:12) (1x <3): and concluded that body fat % was the #1 factor for attractiveness in both men and women
Mark (2013-11-07 11:12): muscle mass was further down the list
Mark (2013-11-07 11:12) (1x <3): and men and women are very good at judging bodyfat % from just looking at someone's face
Mark (2013-11-07 11:12): i found that interesting
Nate (2013-11-07 11:12) (1x <3): So basically if I get my body fat down I'll be snaking girls from you guys just be standing there
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:12): The #1 factor for male attractiveness is the behaviors induced by high testosterone levels
Mark (2013-11-07 11:13): maybe
Mark (2013-11-07 11:13): this study only focused on physical features
Nate (2013-11-07 11:13): yeah thats why its flawed
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:13): What I mean to say is, it isn't the fact that you're built like a brick shithouse
Mark (2013-11-07 11:13): but it answers the muscular vs lean debate
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:13): It's the testosterone coursing through your veins, altering your behavior
Mark (2013-11-07 11:14): women respond to muscularity in a primal way
Nate (2013-11-07 11:14): Speaking of testosterone, what do you think I should do with this girl tomorrow night?  It's a friday so a lot of shit is crowded
Mark (2013-11-07 11:14): as an indicator of physical power and thus ability to protect
Nate (2013-11-07 11:16): yeah muscles definitely help your game
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:17): @Nate Hmm... I dunno
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:17): Take her to your apartment
Nate (2013-11-07 11:17): well fitness definitely does
Nate (2013-11-07 11:17): well once she's at my apartment my fitness level means absolutely nothing
Mark (2013-11-07 11:17): ideally, you'd have some muscle, not a shit ton, but some... and <10% bodyfat
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:18) (1x <3): By the way, thanks Mark for turning me into a fatty
Mark (2013-11-07 11:18): i was waiting for you to get fat before i discussed this topic
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:18): It's your fault, since I don't have any agency of my own
Mark (2013-11-07 11:18): for maximal impact
Nate (2013-11-07 11:19): My problem is my body is so damn injury prone :(
Mark (2013-11-07 11:19): it's ok, i just ate 6 ice cream cones
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:19): @Nate I shouldn't ask Dana out tonight
Nate (2013-11-07 11:19): @Xander no I wouldn't recommend it.
Mark (2013-11-07 11:20): according to 4square you were with dana last night
Mark (2013-11-07 11:20): is this true
Nate (2013-11-07 11:20): Ask her out for monday
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:21):  @Mark No, I was just trying to annoy her
Nate (2013-11-07 11:21): hmm, I wanna ask this girl out for friday, but I don't want to spend a ton of cash until I find out if this girl is worth the cash...  Need a good dive bar to go to that won't be ridiculously crowded
Nate (2013-11-07 11:21): dive or not super pricey
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:23): Earlyish its usually not too crowded at most low key pubs in ur hood Nate dawg
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:23) (2x <3): I'm the asshole mayor of 204 10th St, Jersey City
Nate (2013-11-07 11:24): @jimmy any good ones you know of that have decent seating for kino?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 11:27): There's a string of them on 3rd ave, south of 23rd. they all seem relatively dead
Nate (2013-11-07 11:30): I'll go take a look during lunch
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:35): so I threw out all my pot this morning
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:36): I'm quiting smoking 
Mark (2013-11-07 11:37): what
Mark (2013-11-07 11:37): i would've taken it off you
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:37): oh haha yeah well 
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:37): I felt like being impulsive
Mark (2013-11-07 11:37): how much did you have left
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:37): about 2 grams
Mark (2013-11-07 11:38): why are you quitting
Mark (2013-11-07 11:39): just smoke only on the weekends or something
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:40): I have no self control
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:40): when it comes to pot
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:41): @Phillatio I'm all about being impulsive
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:41): *slaps froyo out of your hand*
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:41): lol 
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:41): Mark is still salty about that one
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:41) (2x <3): I'm generally smarter faster less lazy and have better memory when I don't smoke
Mark (2013-11-07 11:42): you owe me an ice cream xander
Mark (2013-11-07 11:42): i haven't forgotten
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:42): I hope you like ice cream enemas
Mark (2013-11-07 11:42): almost as much as sriracha enemas
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:43): That's basically just an average day's poo for me
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 11:46): Btw, I texted Emily last night
Phillatio (2013-11-07 11:47): oh nice

Mark (2013-11-07 14:28): it's not overt
Mark (2013-11-07 14:29): subtle is always fine
Mark (2013-11-07 14:29): innuendo is something that can be interpreted multiple ways
Mark (2013-11-07 14:29): which makes it fun
Nate (2013-11-07 14:29): okee, I'll send that then, and see what happens :)

Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 14:32): Imo its coming off a bit strong but that depends on how attracted to u she is at this point
Nate (2013-11-07 14:32): We spoke for about 2 mins total
Nate (2013-11-07 14:33): There is a chance she thinks I'm working in film because I work in the same building as her casting call, but I don't think that's it

Nate (2013-11-07 15:57): blame xander, he suggested it
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 15:57): Well, obviously I meant at the opportune moment!
Phillatio (2013-11-07 15:58): I'm 90% sure you shouldn't give a shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:00): I'm 100% sure you shouldn't give a shit
Mark (2013-11-07 16:01): that's a given, but it's good to dissect it for learning purposes
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:01): Nuh uh! Just do 1000 more approaches
Mark (2013-11-07 16:01): just caught another model on okc
Mark (2013-11-07 16:01): http://ak3.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/0x3/540x543/0/4646672859942598202.jpeg
Mark (2013-11-07 16:02): not sure if these girls are real models though
Mark (2013-11-07 16:02): probably just did like 1 photo shoota
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:02): Her face looks kinda manly
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:02): In that picture
Mark (2013-11-07 16:02) (1x <3): models have very angular faces
Mark (2013-11-07 16:02): like pretty androgynous 
Mark (2013-11-07 16:03): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/ef06ffa02a1d0131b8cc12313b12cc51
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:04): I like the similar users a soft cock
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:04): oo she's in or out on a friday night
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:05): @Mark Shit, she's a horse girl. Abort, abort!
Mark (2013-11-07 16:05): still trying to decide if she's real
Mark (2013-11-07 16:05): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/3ea94e502a1e0131a94222000ae848a8
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:05): I fucking hate horses
Mark (2013-11-07 16:05): i like nerds though
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:05): And consequently, horse girls
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:05): They're always disturbed
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:05): she's not a real nerd
Mark (2013-11-07 16:05): maybe she just likes the feeling of being on top of an animal
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:05): I like horses
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:06): just not women who like them
Mark (2013-11-07 16:07): well if she were some hotshot model she wouldn't be on okc
Mark (2013-11-07 16:07): idk
Mark (2013-11-07 16:07): the horse thing probably means she's a princess
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:08): she listed it first
Mark (2013-11-07 16:09) (2x <3): http://ak0.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/0x0/1125x1125/0/11607860048293707923.jpeg
Mark (2013-11-07 16:09): some sideboob

Mark (2013-11-07 16:11) (1x <3): you need to fuck the paranoia out of her system
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:11): her betaness is fucking annoying 
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:11): Seriously

Nate (2013-11-07 16:28): Have we decided where we're going tonight?
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:29): TIT DIRT
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:30): It sounds like Chewbacca takin a shit! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!
Mark (2013-11-07 16:34): who are you people
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:34): let me tell you about a porcupine's balls their small and they don't give a SHIT
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 16:39): Shit
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 16:39): So
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 16:39): I was in GCS
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 16:40): Did like 4 approaches
Mark (2013-11-07 16:42): all that ice cream from earlier today is trying to escape my body in a violent way
Mark (2013-11-07 16:42): ughhhh
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 16:45): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/d17f12c02a230131b8cd12313b12cc51
Nate (2013-11-07 16:46): rail thin
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:47): I'd like to steam roll that bitch
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:51) (1x <3): A rail thin chick who's askin for a railin'
Mark (2013-11-07 16:54): did you get her #
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:55): Did u get a blumpkin
Phillatio (2013-11-07 16:58): I want a blumpkin
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 16:59) (1x <3): @Phillatio You only have to wait until 7
Mark (2013-11-07 16:59): just had a type 6 on the bristol scale
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:00): I had a 3.5 earlier. It was super sticky, though
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:00): oh I should text that tranny
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:00): OK
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:00): see if he/she wants to give me a blumpkin
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:00): sorry work meeting
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:00): Fuck guys
Mark (2013-11-07 17:01): no thx
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:01): Was havinf a decent day, 3 rejections but happy I approached
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:01): This was the last one and it was going super well
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:02): She was putting her # in my phone when this fat fucker w/ a goatie shows up
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:02) (1x <3): Eyes wide with omega rage
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:02): and says "how many girls u talk to? I've seen u hit on at least 10 girls here"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:03): I am shocked...say hey that guys lying
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:03): She gets visibly uncomfortable and says "ok I'm going to catch my train" , leaves
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:03): I would have kicked him in the nuts as hard as I possibly could
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:04): So he's walking away and I tell yell at him "Hey you, get back here"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:04): He turns back around and is angry, lookin for some trouble
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:04): I ask Why would you do something like that?  Man-to-man, just man up and tell me why you pulled that shit?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:05): He says Fuck you, I don't need this shit and walks away
Nate (2013-11-07 17:05): Wow, what an asshole
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:05): wow
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:05): I'm still yelling at him Come back here and have a fucking conversation like a man, own up to what you just did right now
Mark (2013-11-07 17:05): did he work there or just some random chode
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:05): Random chode
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:05): I'm fucking angry
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:05): and I wasn't even there
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:06): I wanna hurt someone
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:06): Had like a military (or fishing) vest and a Yankees cap
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:06): what a little cunt
Mark (2013-11-07 17:06): you shouldn't have bought into his frame by getting defensive
Mark (2013-11-07 17:06): but yeah what a dick move
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:06): It stings because that was the best approach all day
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:07): @Mark for the life of me, I couldn't think of anything clever to turn it around in that moment
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:07) (1x <3): I really should commit to improv lol
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:07): that's pretty tough
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:07): idk what I would have done
Mark (2013-11-07 17:07): i would've said 'hey, have you met my dad?'
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:07): lol that's good
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:08): This chick was super cute.  Freshman @ Hunter
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:08) (1x <3): "Hey sugartits, get back here"
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:09): At the dude
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:09): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/2cf62b102a270131a94222000ae848a8
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:09): We made plans to get togetehr next wk and everything :(
Nate (2013-11-07 17:09): If there was ever a reason to beat someone senseless, you just found it
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:10): seriously I don't think I could have contained myself
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:10): He just robbed you of your genetic destiny
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:10): I've seen this happen in USQ but it was an amog move by another PUA
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:10): we should practice on each other
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:10): try to blow the others out of sets
Nate (2013-11-07 17:11): That is literally the first time I've ever heard of that.  Only reaction I've ever gotten was guys and girls high fiving me
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:11): @Jimmy Your experience reminded me of this: http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/the-alpha-male-pose/
Mark (2013-11-07 17:11): well, you always run this risk when you game in a relatively small space
Mark (2013-11-07 17:11): idk
Mark (2013-11-07 17:11): like stores, but gcs seems large enough
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:11): The part at the end of that post where it talks about the "creepy mask symbolizing the peeping tom celibate omega male staring at you with seething envy"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:11): He has absolutely nothing to gain from doing that
Mark (2013-11-07 17:12): he gains the satisfaction from cockblocking you
Nate (2013-11-07 17:12): @jimmy hatred is its own reward.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:12): The USQ thing makes sense; the 2nd pua comes along and uses the 1st one as a jumpoff point 
Mark (2013-11-07 17:12): it's lame but it's true
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:12): And steals the girl
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:12): It's his white knight mating strategy. Maybe girls will recognize what a nice guy he is, saving them from evil PUAs and will have sex with him
Mark (2013-11-07 17:14): he sounded old though
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:14) (2x <3): maybe he was trying to make you better and deal with unexpected situations
Mark (2013-11-07 17:14): ^ that's the right way to frame it
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:14) (2x <3): Okay, Phillatio Bobbins
Mark (2013-11-07 17:14): as a learning opportunity
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:16): "You must be mistaking me for some other Asian guys. You white people seem to do that a lot"
Mark (2013-11-07 17:16): too defensive
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:16): "No I'm pretty sure it was you, w/ the nerdy glasses"
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:16): I would have went with have you met my dad
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:17): of course I would have never thought of that in the moment
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:17): Yes!
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:17): He said that, or his imagined response?
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): i would've said 'hey, have you met my dad? sorry, he gets this way after a few drinks'
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:17): And then invite him into the set 
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:17): Mark said that
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): 'let's go over there'
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): don't stick around
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): you won't get him to leave
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): you have to move with the girl
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:17): Yah...in this instance, she did have to run to catch her train
Mark (2013-11-07 17:17): inviting him into the set is just asking for trouble
Nate (2013-11-07 17:18): if this ever happens again, leave with her as she goes and keep talking
Nate (2013-11-07 17:18): don't let her walk away alone
Mark (2013-11-07 17:18): yeah
Mark (2013-11-07 17:19): either way, still pretty tough because once you've got the pua label slapped on you
Mark (2013-11-07 17:19): it's a death knell for daygame
Nate (2013-11-07 17:19) (1x <3): Mark, I had a girl I was seeing literally watch me pick up another girl without me knowing, and we went out again
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:19): I haven't texted her yet
Mark (2013-11-07 17:20): wait, so you did get her #
Mark (2013-11-07 17:20): don't see what the problem is
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:20): Lol yeah...this all went down right as she was putting her # in
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:20): It was too late 
Nate (2013-11-07 17:20): @jimmy if you have her number pretend it never happened.  Just send some "It was really a pleasure talking to you.  I have a fun place in mind when we hang out next week"
Mark (2013-11-07 17:21) (1x <3): no, you should call out the elephant in the room asap
Nate (2013-11-07 17:21): Then he's on the defensive before he even started
Mark (2013-11-07 17:21): but don't dwell on it
Mark (2013-11-07 17:21): it shows social intelligence, and the tone doesn't have to be defensive
Nate (2013-11-07 17:22) (1x <3): Well when the girl caught me, my strategy was to be unapologetic.
Nate (2013-11-07 17:22) (1x <3): I said I was talking to other girls, because we weren't serious
Mark (2013-11-07 17:22): this girl is young though, and was visibly shaken up
Mark (2013-11-07 17:23): since this chode got into their face
Nate (2013-11-07 17:23): also to be fair, it was never quite the same again
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:23): Okay, what would you text here?
Mark (2013-11-07 17:23): the pua label might not be a death knell, but it puts you in a hole to dig out of
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:24): There's only one hole I want to be digging out of right now, and its hers
Nate (2013-11-07 17:24): Well you do have her number, so its possible to dig out of this
Nate (2013-11-07 17:24): and into her
Mark (2013-11-07 17:24): something like 'hey, sorry about that weirdo back at the train station. he gets that way after a few drinks'
Mark (2013-11-07 17:24): you can always recover if you have the #, yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:25): If you're sociopathic enough, none of it should matter
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:25): Would u own up to talking to other girls?
Mark (2013-11-07 17:25): of course
Mark (2013-11-07 17:25): just have to phrase it right
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:25) (1x <3): "It's not my fault that girls think I'm sexy"
Nate (2013-11-07 17:26) (2x <3): I just say "I'm a friendly guy, I talk to everyone"
Mark (2013-11-07 17:26) (3x <3): i usually go with 'if i see someone interesting, i go over and say hi. i've met some of my best friends this way. that's the beauty of living in new york'
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:26): Wow, that's good
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:27): All of those are good tbh
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:27): I wonder if this is too dick of me ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/bdab9c802a290131b8cd12313b12cc51
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:28): yes
Mark (2013-11-07 17:28): too needy
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:28): Don't send
Mark (2013-11-07 17:28): not enough dick
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:28): Don't send
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:28): @Mark No, you're wrong
Nate (2013-11-07 17:28): Send dick pic
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:28): But zoom so it looks HUGE
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:28): You're forgetting that she said almost that exact same line two days ago, so I'm just openly mocking her
Mark (2013-11-07 17:28): oh yes i remember now
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:28) (1x <3): I didn't forget that
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:28): I still think its too needy
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:29): just in a different way
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:29): I wish I could do the Archer thing, except through text
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:29): Hey gents, so where are we meeting at 7pm
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:29): Just keep yelling TONIGHT louder and louder
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:29) (1x <3): I think Mark should decide since we're meeting in Chinatown and that's his home turf
Mark (2013-11-07 17:29): i have date at 7 but can meet after if it sucks
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:30): Rick's Cabaret, of course
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:30): Oh 
Nate (2013-11-07 17:32) (1x <3): That indian girl just called me her best friend, except she was also saying we have compatible signs (we are a match), asking if I'm married, and wants to tell me about her dream of being married
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:32): Maybe she thinks I actually went there
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:32): @Nate Tell her to fuck off
Nate (2013-11-07 17:33): Naah, screw that.  She has no idea what's in store for her when we get together
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:33): no I think you should tell her you want o get married
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:33): then fuck her 
Phillatio (2013-11-07 17:33): and then tell her to fuck off
Mark (2013-11-07 17:33): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:33) (1x <3): You should tell her to fuck off, then fuck her, then remind her that you told her to fuck off
Nate (2013-11-07 17:34): Why not just fuck her
Nate (2013-11-07 17:34): That's what I'm gonna do
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:34): Now we're talkin
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:34): Honestly, just let her pile on the text messages
Nate (2013-11-07 17:34): All the bullshit she's saying now won't mean jack when we get together
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:34): She seems like the kind of chick who will send you like 10 messages before waiting for you to respond
Nate (2013-11-07 17:34): @Xander I already did pile them on.  She wants to meet Saturday
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:35): She's like... hyperthyroidal or something. I know the type
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:35): http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Phgjdf5iNnbtblh6MYf64g/l.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:35): http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s24UNrP-4kZxiF33_Etefw/l.jpg
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:35): http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NcXolS3Uc8QIWnndYzLDVg/l.jpg
Nate (2013-11-07 17:35): As soon as we start talking about romance and sex, and my hands start wandering all over her, she'll be begging me to fuck her hard
Mark (2013-11-07 17:35): food porn
Nate (2013-11-07 17:36): I didn't confirm yet for saturday night, but I will tomorrow.  I told her I wasn't sure
Jimmyayo (2013-11-07 17:36): Shit looks delish.  Can we just go here? 
Nate (2013-11-07 17:37): There is no way this chick only wants me as a friend.

Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:39): @Nate She's doing all the work for you! Just let that hamster wheel spin!
Nate (2013-11-07 17:40): I am, at some point I cut her off because we already agreed to get together and I want to save that energy for the date
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:40): Hamster wheels are like perpetual motion machines
Nate (2013-11-07 17:41): Well I told her she'll have to save the romance dream story for when we get together right before I cut her off.  Now she's going to be thinking about that dream the whole time till we get together
Xander Xone (2013-11-07 17:41): Good stuff

Nate (2013-11-07 17:43): I don't want to feel like we're getting takeout.  It doesn't have to be expensive tho.

Nate (2013-11-08 08:52): how was last night?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:05): Alright
Nate (2013-11-08 10:05): More details :)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:14): We split up, Nick, Marcus and I went to Hotel Chantelle, then Marcus went to see a show @ Lavo
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:15): Mark, Phil and I went to Piano's Phebe's, and 13th Step
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:15) (1x <3): Nick and I ended up hanging out w/ these 4 older Dutch women.  Not really hitting on them but just having fun, they were super fun/sweet.  1 of them ran the NYC marathon.  As we left the runner came and kissed me on the mouth 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:16): Then Nick and I devoured some delicious wraps & cheesy tater tots @ Wolfnights around 3am
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:16): How was it Xandy?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:17): Chantelle was decent around 1am but only like half full
Nate (2013-11-08 10:18): @jimmy was that at the speakeasy?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:18): Nothing amazing
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:18): Nah we didn't stay at the speakeasy long 
Nate (2013-11-08 10:18): ahh
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:19): And Mark checked himself into an eating disorder rehab clinic
Nate (2013-11-08 10:19): I was hoping none of you went after the chick I number closed :)
Nate (2013-11-08 10:19): Good for him
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:19): I was considering it, just to be a troll
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:20) (3x <3): I did my 2nd ever subway approach this morning omw to work!
Nate (2013-11-08 10:20): congrats jimmy!
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:20): The problem is that I was in a food coma most of the night
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:20): ANd it only started dissipating once Mark left, only to be replaced with drunkenness
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:21): At 13th step
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:21): But the drunkenness was much preferable
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:21) (2x <3): It was indirect though, situational opener.  Some nutjob w/ a crutch was shadow boxing next to us, so we were both laughing at that as we sat down next to e/o.  Said nutjob - awesome wingman!
Nate (2013-11-08 10:21): haha
Nate (2013-11-08 10:21): So this time the nutjob got you the number
Nate (2013-11-08 10:22): @jimmy when you do saturday dates, what do you typically do?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:22): Daytime or night?
Nate (2013-11-08 10:22): night
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:23): Go earlyish (before 9), wine bars are great 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:23): Or a chill dive bar
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:24): One of my favorite spots ever is La Lanterna, on Macdougal.  Go downstairs where it's super dark and you can hear the live jazz from the other room
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:24): I almost got raped by my date there once 
Nate (2013-11-08 10:25): haha
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:25): Great place, i've recommended it to a few other guys for dates and they all had good success
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:25): One guy I think fingered his chick in Wash Sq Park right after they left lanterna
Nate (2013-11-08 10:25): I'll check it out
Nate (2013-11-08 10:25): nice
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:32): @Nate Did you end up going out with your friend?
Nate (2013-11-08 10:32): yeah, we hung out for a while at my place and went to max brenners
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:33): Awww ;)

Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:40): I think I'm still a little drunk
Nate (2013-11-08 10:40): Indian girl doesn't drink, this is so not gonna be worth it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:40): Rohypnotize her
Nate (2013-11-08 10:42): haha will do
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:44): She will drink your seed
Nate (2013-11-08 10:45) (1x <3): hope so, she defines herself as '100% muslim'
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:49): You know, I have noticed that using comically beta phrases in other languages goes over fairly well
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:49): Eczample?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:50): "Donde estan tus besos?"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:50): ¿Por ejemple?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:50): Hmmm
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:51): Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben!
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:52) (2x <3): Anyway, it was awesome seeing 8/9 of the Closers last night. A real treat!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:53): Hell yes
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:54) (1x <3): The real treat was watching Mark inhale his food. made me gag a little
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:54): I ate my noodles quickly
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:54) (1x <3): Did u end up taking a shit?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 10:54): Lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:54) (1x <3): It was Phil's noodles that were the problem
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 10:55): @Jimmyayo Yeah, it made me feel a bit better
Phillatio (2013-11-08 11:00) (1x <3): my noodles are always causing trouble
Phillatio (2013-11-08 11:00): just got to work
Nate (2013-11-08 11:01): @Xander maybe you should lay off the hot stuff for a while
Phillatio (2013-11-08 11:02): or you could pull a Mark and eat a whole package of tums
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:02) (1x <3): Fun night guys. Next Meetup in midtown or east village please. Or maybe everyone should come to Jersey. #bigasspancakes ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0b85f2d02abd0131b8cc12313b12cc51
Nate (2013-11-08 11:03): Trying to decide is large pancakes is worth the banishment of Jersey

Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 11:08): http://vimeo.com/76441801
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:08): Lavo was 70% females, 35% of which were 8+
Phillatio (2013-11-08 11:08): you got those percentages pretty precisely there 
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:08): Tokya r we going there for the next meetup
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 11:09) (1x <3): Jersey City is actually pretty good, though Marcus wouldn't know, since he never spends any time here
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:09): Yeah Phil right out of my a$$
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 11:09): Yeah it's pretty ridiculous.  Highest concentration of hot girls I've seen
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:10): Xander u never showed me the path
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 11:15): Did u find it intimidating at all Marcus?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 11:15): @Marcus I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.
Marcus (2013-11-08 11:18): @jimmy Yeah it very intimidating at first

Phillatio (2013-11-08 12:43): ah

Nate (2013-11-08 12:44): My mind is blanking on what's a good thing to say here tho
Nate (2013-11-08 12:44): I don't want to start dhving her
Nate (2013-11-08 13:01): Might just change the subject
Phillatio (2013-11-08 13:03): idk I can't think of anything
Phillatio (2013-11-08 13:03): but I feel like you should push it a bit further

Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 14:56) (1x <3): HLB promoters will often pull the bait and switch. they are the scum of the earth
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 14:58): hydrophilic-lipophilic balance?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 14:59) (1x <3): They'll invite you and ask u to bring cute girls, you tell the doorguy the promoter's name and he gets credit for # of ppl he brings in.  Then either 1) he'll just not show up, or 2) tell u that u can't sit at his table cuz it's too crowded, but he'll bring back drinks for u - then never appear again
Mark (2013-11-08 14:59): this surfactant is a wetting agent
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 15:00) (1x <3): There are lots of scumbag promoters, the trick is to find a good one - and being a man of high value to him

Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:36): What kind of games is she playing?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:36): Just grope her
Nate (2013-11-08 15:37): She likes to say/do things to get a rise out of me
Nate (2013-11-08 15:38): she's subconsciously testing my alpha frame, but it's annoying as fuck
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:38): Go dark
Mark (2013-11-08 15:38): welcome to the world of fashion models Nate
Nate (2013-11-08 15:38): Yeah hence me practicing on her
Nate (2013-11-08 15:39): @Xander I reacted slightly more than I should, but not nearly what she was looking for.  If she gives me more shit tho def going dark

Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 15:41) (1x <3): "But I didn't even send u my best text yet!"

Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:44): That's what I usually do
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:46) (2x <3): Too much real talk in the main chat. The beta scurried off to hide
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:46): *betas
Phillatio (2013-11-08 15:48) (2x <3): @Xander stealing those beers wasn't such a great idea
Phillatio (2013-11-08 15:48) (2x <3): I think I gave myself a cold

Xander Xone (2013-11-08 15:52): I don't have the fire to keep pursuing them
Mark (2013-11-08 15:53): actually i shouldn't say that
Mark (2013-11-08 15:53) (1x <3): that's putting too much pressure on yourself

Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 16:17): Worthless
Nate (2013-11-08 16:35) (2x <3): my happiness is too attached to my success with women

Xander Xone (2013-11-08 16:47): @Mark They're hopeless
Mark (2013-11-08 16:49) (2x <3): you can tell how bored i am at work by how much effort i'm putting into this black hole
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 16:50) (1x <3): That's what she said
Mark (2013-11-08 16:50): AE is so delusional
Mark (2013-11-08 16:50): thing is, if he had more self awareness, then he would be better at game
Mark (2013-11-08 16:50): it kind of explains why he sucks at game
Mark (2013-11-08 16:50): he's closed mindedf
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 16:50): I don't even know who the fuck that other guy is, but apparently he lives in the SF bay area
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 16:51): He's been around for a long time
Nate (2013-11-08 16:51): @Mark that's ignorance, those who know nothing are better off than those that think they do and are wrong
Mark (2013-11-08 16:51): to be honest, all of this theory is way too advanced for his ass
Mark (2013-11-08 16:51): he needs to read magic bullets or some shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 16:51): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 16:52) (1x <3): But I thiroughly enjoyed all that shit u both posted there
Mark (2013-11-08 16:52) (1x <3): maybe he's right, this theory will only hurt him at this stage
Mark (2013-11-08 16:52) (1x <3): he needs gimmicky training wheels for where he's at
Nate (2013-11-08 17:03): Indian Girl: "Everyone is getting married, why not me?"
Nate (2013-11-08 17:03): haha we know why
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:03): "Because you're fat"
Nate (2013-11-08 17:03) (1x <3): I'm not responding at all
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:03): Good
Mark (2013-11-08 17:04): thing with models is that they suffer from choice overload
Mark (2013-11-08 17:04) (2x <3): research has shown that the more choices you have, the less happy you are
Mark (2013-11-08 17:05) (2x <3): http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html
Nate (2013-11-08 17:05) (1x <3): She's 33 and actually Pakistani (didn't care) and Muslim in a culture that values youth in women more than most.  She's past her expiration date.
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:05): The paradox of choice, I believe it's called
Mark (2013-11-08 17:05): my roommate was telling me how in NY, models are always thinking they can do better, even when the reality is different
Mark (2013-11-08 17:06): and they will never get what they want unless they change their mindset
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:07) (2x <3): They keep thinking that until they hit the wall...
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:07) (2x <3): Tragic, really
Nate (2013-11-08 17:08): they marry a beta and are miserable
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:09): or they get pregnant
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:09): and then marry the beta
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:09) (1x <3): I've always been against raising someone else's children 
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:09): ever since I was a kid
Nate (2013-11-08 17:10): I'm against any children whether they are mine or not
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:10) (2x <3): I had no idea why.. now I realize it's because I'm inherintentely alpha
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:10): I need to spread my seed
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:10): Yeah, I always thought it was repulsive
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:10): pretty much
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:10): Might as well shoot your own balls off
Nate (2013-11-08 17:11): I like my balls, just not their function
Nate (2013-11-08 17:13): without my balls how would I sit on a girls face and make her lick them
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:13) (1x <3): Without my balls, how would I give Nate arabian goggles?
Phillatio (2013-11-08 17:14) (3x <3): "These are my balls. There are many like them, but these are mine. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me my balls are useless. Without my balls, I am useless. "
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:16) (1x <3): SNL or bust tongiht
Nate (2013-11-08 17:17): buist a nut
Nate (2013-11-08 17:17): bust

Mark (2013-11-08 17:17): i'm dying
Nate (2013-11-08 17:17): we are eating now
Mark (2013-11-08 17:18): everyone except for me, great
Nate (2013-11-08 17:18): @Mark I've never met someone with a wierder relationship with food than you
Mark (2013-11-08 17:18) (2x <3): the hell with women, give me food
Mark (2013-11-08 17:18) (1x <3): food doesn't say no
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:19): Even if it did, I'd eat it anyway
Mark (2013-11-08 17:19) (1x <3): i want my burger to scream when i put it into my mouth
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:19): I wonder how many of those fuckers in the other chat even read
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:20): I like my burgers like I like my sex: raw
Nate (2013-11-08 17:20): @Xander I will read any 1 book this weekend, choose that book, any book
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:20): The Chronicles of Narnia
Nate (2013-11-08 17:20): I've read that
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:21): I was trolling
Mark (2013-11-08 17:21): eat pray love
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:21): Obvi
Mark (2013-11-08 17:21): i'm not trolling
Nate (2013-11-08 17:21): Duh
Nate (2013-11-08 17:21): Chronicles of Naria is the bible with jesus as a lion
Nate (2013-11-08 17:21): narnia
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:21): So what you're saying is... I'm a lion
Nate (2013-11-08 17:21): You used to be, but you got red with a long nose
Mark (2013-11-08 17:22): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/30bcfaa02af20131a94222000ae848a8
Nate (2013-11-08 17:22): What is your non-troll choice xander
Mark (2013-11-08 17:23) (1x <3): god i hope she's not going to blab about work the whole date
Mark (2013-11-08 17:23) (1x <3): fucking finance chicks
Nate (2013-11-08 17:23): Well who's fault is that, you kept the topic finance the whole time
Mark (2013-11-08 17:23): alright fine
Mark (2013-11-08 17:24): that's been my experience so far though
Mark (2013-11-08 17:24): with these career bitches
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:24): @Mark On the trading floor? Her jaw is likely cut from diamond
Nate (2013-11-08 17:24): It's cut from men
Mark (2013-11-08 17:24): if she wasn't so hot i wouldn't do this
Mark (2013-11-08 17:25): that's the danger of meeting women in midtown
Mark (2013-11-08 17:25): i think she's like a glorified secretary or something
Mark (2013-11-08 17:25): not a trader
Nate (2013-11-08 17:25): My suggestion, don't let her talk about work AT ALL.  Just change the topic to anything else.
Nate (2013-11-08 17:26) (1x <3): Bitch I talk about this shit all day, why would I want to talk about it with you.  
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:27): I hear Antifragile is good, Nate
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:27): I've been meaning to read it
Mark (2013-11-08 17:28): i don't like that one
Mark (2013-11-08 17:28): fooled by randomness is his best one
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:28): Hmm
Mark (2013-11-08 17:28): after that, his ego exploded and he started masturbating instead of writing
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:28): Haha
Nate (2013-11-08 17:29):  That's what one of the first reviews said
Mark (2013-11-08 17:29): for instance, the black swan is total garbage and filled with smug, esoteric references to retarded academic trivia
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:30): Oh jeeze, I'll have to avoid it then
Mark (2013-11-08 17:30) (1x <3): thinking fast and slow is awesome
Mark (2013-11-08 17:30): it's written by taleb's personal hero, kahnemen 
Nate (2013-11-08 17:30): @Xander Well then I'm guessing it's not your final answer :)
Mark (2013-11-08 17:30): best behavrioal psychologist living
Mark (2013-11-08 17:31): anything by kahneman is good
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:31): http://www.amazon.com/The-Rational-Animal-Evolution-Smarter/dp/0465032427
Mark (2013-11-08 17:31) (1x <3): read his original papers, they are written so well that laymen can understand them
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:31): This came highly recommended, and I intend to read it soon
Mark (2013-11-08 17:31): not the typical academic circlejerk with the terminology and such
Nate (2013-11-08 17:32): Okay I'm expanding that to the two of you, decide my fate, what book shall I read
Nate (2013-11-08 17:32): I will read any choice you give, no matter what it is
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:32): Read that one
Nate (2013-11-08 17:32): the rational animal?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:32): Then we can discuss it, since I'm gonna read it
Mark (2013-11-08 17:32): read both
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:32): Yes
Mark (2013-11-08 17:32): read all 3
Nate (2013-11-08 17:33): I don't have that much time this weekend Mark :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:33): Which 3?
Mark (2013-11-08 17:33): well no i take that back, fooled by randomness overlaps with kahneman's book
Mark (2013-11-08 17:33): and kahneman has much better shit than taleb
Mark (2013-11-08 17:36): so are we eating or what
Mark (2013-11-08 17:37): i'm just sitting here masturbating when i could be eating
Nate (2013-11-08 17:37): I'm looking at books and drinking wine
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 17:38): I can't make it out tonight till much later probz
Mark (2013-11-08 17:38) (2x <3): Nate has become a woman
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:38): I'm still at work until 6:00
Mark (2013-11-08 17:39) (1x <3): a classy broad that i would bang ofc
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:39) (1x <3): He's just learning how to see things from a woman's perspective, for the purposes of Game, obviously
Mark (2013-11-08 17:39): do you want to eat on stone st xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:40): Why is the world trade center PATH station so far away from Stone St
Jimmyayo (2013-11-08 17:40) (1x <3): Ru guys going out later?
Mark (2013-11-08 17:40): is it far?
Mark (2013-11-08 17:41) (1x <3): i think it seemed far because you got lost last time
Nate (2013-11-08 17:41) (1x <3): @Mark is that a metaphor for life?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:42): https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=World+Trade+Center+%4040.712710,-74.011930&daddr=Stone+St,+New+York,+NY&hl=en&sll=40.708426,-74.011223&sspn=0.011858,0.022724&geocode=FQY6bQId5qqW-w%3BFRIYbQIdO6yW-yn3AoMbFFrCiTEbPE_LcDLoog&oq=stone&dirflg=w&mra=ls&t=m&z=16
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:43): Look at how far that is. I can't be expected to walk that
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:43): I demand a rickshaw
Nate (2013-11-08 17:43): That would be fun, why don't we have rickshaws
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:44): @Nate Feminism.
Nate (2013-11-08 17:44): I was gonna make a bad asian joke but I'm actually tired of that and I respect Mark too much to keep doing them
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:46): Dude... I've learned so much about game today
Mark (2013-11-08 17:46) (1x <3): love you too Nate
Mark (2013-11-08 17:47): but i have a thick skin, it's all in good fun
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:47): I'm gonna go out and appeal to girls' sex drives when I'm picking them up
Nate (2013-11-08 17:47): Oh I know you do
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:47): "Hey sugaritits, I know you want it just as bad as I do, so we gon fuck or what?"
Nate (2013-11-08 17:47): They call that the Apocolypse Opener
Mark (2013-11-08 17:48): so you wanna meet in union sq or something xander
Mark (2013-11-08 17:48) (1x <3): or i can meet you halfway from the world trade center and give you a piggyback ride
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:49): "Fuck this club, let's go play FIFA and eat some pizza, brah"
Nate (2013-11-08 17:50): You two are so gonna bang
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:50): USQ?
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:50): I'm guessing SSBM didn't know up
Mark (2013-11-08 17:50): i have a warm bed back at my place just sayin
Mark (2013-11-08 17:50): those usps cunts probably didn't even try to deliver it
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:50): That's a good line
Mark (2013-11-08 17:50): they're lazy as fuck
Mark (2013-11-08 17:52): xander don't ruin my moment with gol
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 17:52): Couldn't help it
Mark (2013-11-08 17:58): alright i'm going home
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 18:02): I give up on that stupid chat
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:06): lol and yes they do
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:07): its pretty hard to have a logical argument about any sort of social issue with a woman
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:07): they get so caught up in their emotions
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:07): and can't think straight
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:08): Jason is kind of pissing me off
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:08): I want to troll him more
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 18:09): He's also using logical fallacies to try to win the argument
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 18:09): Fortunately, I'm well versed in dismantling such bullshit
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 18:15): Okay, I really need to stop
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:17): yep
Phillatio (2013-11-08 18:17): I think you effectively shut everyone up
Xander Xone (2013-11-08 18:18): lol

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 12:38): intense
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 12:45): went to webster hall
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 12:45) (1x <3): fell in love at a rave like i always do and killed the attraction
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 12:46) (1x <3): i hate myself
Mark (2013-11-09 12:46): we ate hotdogs and trolled feminists

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 13:51): ya ur state is pretty much bullet-proof
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 13:51): only posisitive feedback loop, negative thoughts and emotions get blocked out or snuffed out as soon as they appear
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 13:51): but when the drug wears off, ur paying the price for that, mentally.  if there is a girl ur vibing with/yearning for....good luck lol
Nate (2013-11-09 13:52): ahh

Nate (2013-11-09 16:44): Yeah I hate flakes
Nate (2013-11-09 16:44): She said she wasn't coming, replied 'weak'
Nate (2013-11-09 16:44) (2x <3): she called me and said it was cold, told her she was coming and I expected her at 8pm sharp.  She said 'ok'
Phillatio (2013-11-09 16:45): That's some hard-core shit right there
Nate (2013-11-09 16:45): This bitch needs daddy
Phillatio (2013-11-09 16:45): Make her sit on your lap
Phillatio (2013-11-09 16:46): I'm up to 43 matches on tinder
Nate (2013-11-09 16:47): haha you're insane.  I wish I could do that
Nate (2013-11-09 16:48): oh her ass is going on my lap
Nate (2013-11-09 19:16) (1x <3): Hahaha she asked her boyfriend if she could come and he said he wasn't comfortable but she could, LOLOLOL
Nate (2013-11-09 19:17) (2x <3): She called to say she wasn't coming, and I said yes you are.  She says, ok
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 19:45) (2x <3): http://cdn.meme.li/i/pilhc.jpg
Nate (2013-11-09 19:46): oh she's definitely coming because she wants to date me, but whether I'll get any action is another story.  She's got some crazy notions in her head
Nate (2013-11-09 19:47): Doing this just for practice to see what I can accomplish
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-09 19:48): hell yea
Nate (2013-11-09 20:26): Jeesh what a pain in the ass, says she's eating at a bakery 22 mins late.  I have to lecture her on respect.
Nate (2013-11-09 20:38): aaaand she cancelled.  What a child
TiMex (2013-11-09 20:39): This the Indian?
Nate (2013-11-09 20:39): yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-09 20:40): whaddacunt
Nate (2013-11-09 20:41): I feel like texting her to tell her to stop acting like a child if she wants success in life, but that's not worth it
Nate (2013-11-09 20:45): This is why I avoid conservative religious girls.  This one has both been pampered and sheltered her whole life.  She's 33 now and will soon start to lose her looks, but still acts like a spoiled child.

Nate (2013-11-09 22:13): It's a bot
Nate (2013-11-09 22:13): I've seen those exact words
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 01:12) (1x <3): F close in Brooklyn
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 01:13): Jesus, she weighs 90 lbs and is like 5'7"
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 01:14): Props to Mark the Lover for setting up the date by texting for me
Marcus (2013-11-10 01:55): @phil thats a bot - if you keep talking it will send you a link
Marcus (2013-11-10 01:55): @xander nice work she was hot
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 09:19): @Phillatio Despite that being a bot, still love your response
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 09:24) (2x <3): This girl is such a sweetheart. I'm still lying in bed, under-slept and she's grabbing us coffee and breakfast sandwiches from a nearby bodega

Nate (2013-11-10 11:05): I'm not a member of one, but I have access to them definitely
Nate (2013-11-10 11:07): Life never makes anything I do easy.  God really wants me to work for shit :p
Nate (2013-11-10 11:21) (1x <3): I have this <censored> mental image of Xander lying in bed with a girl sucking him off, and he's on his phone browsing this chat..
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-10 11:25): Nate can u do core lifts?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-10 11:26): (squat, deads, bench, overhead press)
Nate (2013-11-10 11:27): Well I don't have the equipment to do deadlifts, and if I do squats with any major weight it's one of the ways I get injuries
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-10 11:27): ah ok
Nate (2013-11-10 11:28): doctors have said that it is possible to fix this issue if I get fit enough, it's just very hard to get started
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 11:45): @Nate You need to check out trigger point therapies in the area
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 11:45): *therapists
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 11:46): It's basically the only shit that had been scientifically proven to help neuromuscular inertia
TiMex (2013-11-10 11:54) (1x <3): Wait how can you do squats without equipment for dead lifts?
Mark (2013-11-10 12:30): all you need is a barbell
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-10 12:31): Mark, do u do compound lifts?
Nate (2013-11-10 14:01) (2x <3): Out on the town doing day game. Join me
Nate (2013-11-10 14:02): You can do squats with dumbells too
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 14:16): I'm at Union square with Mark
Nate (2013-11-10 14:17) (1x <3): At Rockefeller Center on my way in that direction
TiMex (2013-11-10 14:40) (1x <3): Should use barbell for squat
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 14:41): He's doing then at home though. Should get a gym membership for that
Xander Xone (2013-11-10 14:41): We're camped out at the Washington square Starbucks right now

Jimmyayo (2013-11-10 17:24): Half indian/canadian ^o^ ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b8690d802c840131b8cd12313b12cc51

Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 00:20): absoslutly

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:14): Xander you have been given the gift of life today
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:15): question is, what are u going to do with this free time
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:19): @Pippy Long Sausage™ Not much
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:24): For those of you that aren't aware, having a chiseled 6 pack is an awesome feeling
  






  
  



  

    

    

  





  
  

  

  
  

  You get to drop the pervert card on the chicks that check it out
  







  



  

    

    

  




  
  

  

  
  

  And they ALWAYS look

lolololololol
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:24) (1x <3): I just tell them to rub my belly
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:31): haiiiiioooooooo
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:31): Let the trolling commence
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:31): woke up this morning with my stomach in so much pain 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:31): at 6am
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:32) (1x <3): then I took a #7
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:32): What's that
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:33) (3x <3): oh from that shit chart
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:33) (1x <3): I have definitely been hovering around 6.5 for far too many days
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:34): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:35): ugh nilay 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:35): leave me alone
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:35): What's Nilay doing now
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:35): talking to me
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:35) (1x <3): Unforgivable!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:37): Sup Closers
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:37): How was everybody's weekend?
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:38) (1x <3): Fantastic
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:39): I was such a bum, wish I could make my fellow closer brethren proud of some epic pussy slaying conquests, but alas, I was just spankin it for the most part
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:39): Why?
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:40): I put in two solid days of day game. Pretty terrible still, but slow and steady progress was made
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:40): Did some of u guys do the bootcamp w/ ben & charlie?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:40): Wasn't that this past wknd?
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:40): I did
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:41): it was pretty good. I would recommend it to more newbies 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:41): but it was still helpful.. my day game is pretty shitty
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:42): What would you say was one of the biggest takeaways for you?
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:43) (2x <3): high energy works well. and if the set went to shit its probably because you didn't come in with enough energy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:43): i have access to their online webinar
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:43): during day game approach a set walking quickly
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:43): its a rehash of their bootcamp
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:44): it puts you in a state of high energy
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:44): that's about it 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:44): O interesting
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:44): plus their opener was a good set of points to hit on in the first few sentences
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:44): yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:44): 1. get her attention 
2. say this is random 
3. compliment
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:45): 4. I want to meet you
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:45) (1x <3): their opener maybe has a life of 1 more year before it becomes the equivalent of "Who lies mroe, guys or girls"
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:45): 5. hi I'm blah blah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:45): but its still solid, covers the basics and gives guys something to work with
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:45): "Who lies more, guys or girls" is terrible, and it has always been terrible
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:45): yeah but you can put your own spin o it
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:45): on it*
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:45) (1x <3): Opinion openers are for omegas
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:45): they need it ^
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:46): they were very adamant about sticking to the script 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:46): ya if u tell someone starting otu that the opinion opener is the best thign going for him, i think it will calm their anxiety a bit
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:46): ya
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:46): well Closers
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:47): if u want acccess to their online webinar (which is solid IMO) then let me know and we can share login deets
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:47): It's a good structure, for sure.  Putting your own spin on it is going to be pretty essential since daygaming is blowing up 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:47): yeah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:48) (1x <3): one of my favorite mental masturbatory exercises is guessing where daygame will evolve to in next 1-2 years
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:48): yeah well I already changed it a lot
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:49): idk I'm not so sure that it will evolve that much.. it will always be really hard to get into 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:49): and I'm fairly certain that most guys don't have the balls
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:49): yes true true
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:49): I mean as far as it getting popular
Nate (2013-11-11 10:50): I used to use an opinion opener I liked.  The gist of it was is it cheating if the person your with makes out with the same sex at a bar, although I said it in the context of a discussion with a friend
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:50): with the general population
Nate (2013-11-11 10:50) (1x <3): It'll never get popular, too few guys have the balls to do day game, or the persistence to practice it until they are good at it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:51): i have heard of one instance (maybe 2) where the girl called out the B&C Structured Opener
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:51): shoutout to SRU, although that hit ratio aint bad considering it happened to him 1-2 times out of 1000 openers
Nate (2013-11-11 10:51): I've done thousands of them and never had someone call me out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:51): even better news
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:52): just change it every time
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:52): and don't deliver it like lines
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:52): I'm a fairly good actor so I don't think its ever going to come across like lines
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:52): I always add obligatory "ums" and super long pauses 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:53): stuttering
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:53): Lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:53): I don't need to add those
Nate (2013-11-11 10:53): I no longer stutter or act shy doing it, but I change it up frequently
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:53) (1x <3): They add themselves to my approach anwyays
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:53) (1x <3): As Mark said with his bot script on OKCupid, they will often know it's canned but won't care anyway
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:53) (1x <3): Cuz I suuuuuuck
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:53): lol 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:54): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-11 10:54): I think its adds a certain endearing quality to it and makes it sound more legitimate 
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 10:54): Seriously, it's the balls that are respected
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 10:54): very true
Nate (2013-11-11 10:54): I do it now in the context of total comfort, it works just as well as humble, but I can't really fake being nervous anymore, except the rare times I actually am
Nate (2013-11-11 10:55) (1x <3): Doesn't come off as genuine
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 10:56) (3x <3): Amen, being genuine I think is KEY
Nate (2013-11-11 10:56): That's really the most important part, you have to mean what you say
Nate (2013-11-11 10:57): Although for those with serious AA, being nervous can work for you if you do with a bit of silliness.  Even admitting it won't work against you because they'll think it's cute
Nate (2013-11-11 10:58): When i was starting a number of times I choked and the girl thought it was cute
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:00): lol foreal?
Mark (2013-11-11 11:00) (1x <3): i forgot women existed when we were playing smash last night
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:00): #Nirvana
Nate (2013-11-11 11:01): When I used to do more canned lines, I had a girl call me out on it being a line, and I choked and couldn't think of anything to say, and she laughed and gave me her number
Nate (2013-11-11 11:01): We went out a few times
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:01) (1x <3): @Mark A truly devine experience
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:02): I definitely started choking about 2/3 of the way through the night
Nate (2013-11-11 11:02): Yeah these guys made themselves permanently more blind for the sake of the game
Mark (2013-11-11 11:02): i got better after a few drinks
Nate (2013-11-11 11:02) (3x <3): I did pretty well considering I had no idea what the controls were
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:03) (2x <3): You all got to see a little bit of my nerd rage
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:03) (1x <3): I'm a terrible sport
Mark (2013-11-11 11:03) (3x <3): if xander could be as passionate with women as he is with smash, he'd be don juan
Nate (2013-11-11 11:04): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-OYKd8SVrI
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:06) (1x <3): No fucking internet here, so I'm using my phone's wifi
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:06): honestly
Nate (2013-11-11 11:06): @Xander it's the greatest movie clip of all time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:06): the amount of genius/brainstorming.energy involved for the text exchanges that are posted here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:07) (1x <3): you guys could collectively find a cure for cancer or aids if the same amount of thought/effort went into that
Nate (2013-11-11 11:07) (1x <3): But then who would fuck the women
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 11:07): lolll
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:07) (1x <3): When there are entire hospital wings devoted to men's health just like women's heath, then maybe I'll start caring about curing cancer
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:08): #MaleRights
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:08): But I guess men dying years earlier than women on average isn't enough of a moral outrage
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:08): well I'm not sure that has much to do with health care
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:09): men naturally live shorter lives
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:09): I'm pretty sure
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:09): But I thought everything had to be equal in our society!
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:09): Equal wages, equal opportunity, even equal outcome!
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:10) (1x <3): equally miserable*
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:10): Does that mean we should kill women who live past the average male life expectancy?
Nate (2013-11-11 11:11): @Pippy My hormones are pretty nuts.  If a girl wants to suck me off while I come up for a cure for cancer I can do it.  I go from 'really horny' to 'I'm so horny that grandma is starting to look good to me'
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:12) (2x <3): grandma always looks good to me
Nate (2013-11-11 11:14): That's why I don't understand the gay life crowd talking about nofap.  I used to fap like 6 times a day and all it did was make me hornier...
Nate (2013-11-11 11:15): and sleepy
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:15): I used to do that while I was in a relationship
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:15): Man, almost sounds like you have a hormone imbalance
Nate (2013-11-11 11:15): Maybe
Nate (2013-11-11 11:19): Well as hormone imbalances go, I could have worse ones, although it does make it hard to think straight sometimes
Nate (2013-11-11 11:22) (1x <3): I'm really looking forward to having some competition in day game.  It's hard to improve my game much farther without challenging teammates.  I'm gonna get a mic and start recording my approaches so we can all compare notes.
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:25): The main thing I'm competing with at this stage is my day game approach anxiety
Nate (2013-11-11 11:26): I'm not competing, but I want to improve my game and I've hit a bit of a plateau
Mark (2013-11-11 11:27) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/0457f8c02d1c0131420a22000aef140c
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:27): O lord that looks delicious
Nate (2013-11-11 11:27): Xander you are incapable of taking a bad picture..
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:27) (2x <3): And the sandwiches don't look have bad either ;)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:27): *half bad*
Nate (2013-11-11 11:27): pun intended
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:28): My sphincter has been doing a lot of puckering lately
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:29) (2x <3): Are those onion rings on hot dogs?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:29): What is this, pls can someone explain
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:30) (1x <3): Apparently, you've never heard of Papaya King.
Nate (2013-11-11 11:30): It's a heart attack in dog form
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:30) (1x <3): I has
Nate (2013-11-11 11:31): try one covered in cheese and chili
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 11:31): It had that too
Nate (2013-11-11 11:37): I hope that brazilian chick confirms, she was smokin hot
Nate (2013-11-11 11:37): Totally didn't expect her to contact me
Nate (2013-11-11 11:37): Thanks Ben and Charlie
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:39) (1x <3): the only you need to thank is yourself
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:39) (1x <3): ;-)
Nate (2013-11-11 11:39) (1x <3): Well they encouraged me to amp up my energy level to 11, so I came into that set like a crack addict :)
Nate (2013-11-11 11:40) (1x <3): Girl talked to me for 10 minutes in the rain
Phillatio (2013-11-11 11:40) (1x <3): damn cracka 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 11:42): noice!
Nate (2013-11-11 11:46): This mix has me energized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU1NaY4nhSI
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:07): So it sounds like Closers didn't really do any nightgame this past wknd
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:08): Strange...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:08): Oh wait, Pippy went to Webster Hall and had a date w/ Molly lol
Nate (2013-11-11 12:08): I hung out with my friend from college Friday, and got burnt out dealing with crazy girl Saturday and didn't feel like going out
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:11): This is the Indian?
Nate (2013-11-11 12:11): Yeah
Nate (2013-11-11 12:11): Total wackjob
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:11): R u still texting her?
Nate (2013-11-11 12:11): Nope
Nate (2013-11-11 12:12): I was only doing that exercise for practice, and cause she had a fantastic body.
Nate (2013-11-11 12:12): One day of that was enough though
Nate (2013-11-11 12:13): My last text to her was "I hope some day you learn to treat people with respect.  Wish you the best"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:14): Lol ouch
Nate (2013-11-11 12:15): She had these crazy mood swings.  One minute she was saying she was happy with her boyfriend and wanted to only be friends.  The next minute she was saying I was gonna marry her.  Every 30 minutes she would swing the other way.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 12:15) (2x <3): But yeah, sounds like she's a subpar humanoid 
Nate (2013-11-11 12:15): I feel sorry for her beta boyfriend
Nate (2013-11-11 12:16): She was 33 and never married in a culture that marries early.   It was very very obvious why
Nate (2013-11-11 12:19): When she was 23 she was probably at least a high 9.5.  She was still easily a 9 at 33.  Probably used to guys catering to her crazy whims.
Nate (2013-11-11 12:20) (1x <3): Good reference experience
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:21): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH9giCg3Nro
Nate (2013-11-11 12:23): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:23): @Nate That Indian girl sounds like a complete nutjob
Nate (2013-11-11 12:23): She had the crazy stamp tattoo'd on her forehead
Marcus (2013-11-11 12:24): @jimmy is this the molly u speak of - poor pippy ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/07aca2f02d240131420922000aef140c
Nate (2013-11-11 12:25): The tinder title of that pic is: Nate: Haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:25): What molly, and why is that directed at Jimmy but saying poor pippy?
Marcus (2013-11-11 12:26): Jimmy: Oh wait, Pippy went to Webster Hall and had a date w/ Molly lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:26): Oh, okay
Marcus (2013-11-11 12:27) (1x <3): Xander u lucky baster ure still sitting in bed
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:28): Yes I am
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:28) (1x <3): I just leveled up a started pokemon to 37 and its final evolution
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:29): @Jimmy I'm basically through with nightgame for the time being. It sucks
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 12:29): why do u feelit sucks
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 12:29): not judging, just curious
Nate (2013-11-11 12:30) (1x <3): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQ6nINAeq8
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:30): Not worth the energy. You have to jump through too many hoops, and even mediocre girls get their sense of self-esteem inflated to ridiculous levels from all of the guys that aproach them
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:30) (1x <3): I'm also tired of my voice getting raw and going deaf from loud music
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:31): Even though nightgame is my forte, I have to leave it behind
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:32): I would rather grind through sucking at daygame and enjoy myself than have a generally miserable time doing competent nightgame
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 12:33): yeah i understand
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:35): Aw crap, I just got a message and I have no idea who it's from
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:35): It might be from a number that I deleted
Nate (2013-11-11 12:35): hahaha
Nate (2013-11-11 12:35): Do what a girl does "Who is this?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:35): It just says "What's up?"
Nate (2013-11-11 12:36) (1x <3): Say "I lost my phone and got a new one, my contacts are messed up.  Who is this?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:36): That's so obvious
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 12:36): lol
Nate (2013-11-11 12:36): Yep, and I've had girls do that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 12:36) (1x <3): Xander, its payback time bro
Nate (2013-11-11 12:37): When in doubt, do what a girl would do
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:38): lol, I didn't even try to think of something creative
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:39): "Hey, I lost all my phone contacts. Who is this?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:42): Oh good God, it's my employer's omega housemate.
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:42): I feel like he's about to reveal that he has secretly been plotting my demise
Nate (2013-11-11 12:43): He's secretly been in love with you
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 12:45): I like that he lead with "What's up?" Not even, "Hey, are you coming in to work today?" I think he's lonely since he was expecting me...
Nate (2013-11-11 12:47): eww

Phillatio (2013-11-11 12:58): he's a straight up sociopath
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:12) (2x <3): I know, isn't it great?
Phillatio (2013-11-11 13:21): pretty much
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:38): Xander, i know that feel regarding nightgame
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:38): maybe u need to sit back for a minute and assess the situation from outside
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:38): it does  got exhausting having to convey ur value in the most efficient manner everytime u go out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:38): so how does one balance going out and having fun with pushing ur agenda (penis in vag) at the same time
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:39): It's a rat race, anyway
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:39): When I get into my 30s, I'm not gonna be running night game, so I might as well get good at day game now
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:39): yeah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:40): i understand the burnout
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:40): especially in the face of how do we say....less than positive feedback
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:40): It's not just the gaming part, it's the going out at night and partying thing. I've done that for almost a decade
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:41): http://i.imgur.com/F3Q2u.png
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:42): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:45): i think burnout is exacerbated when ur relying on the interactions/sarges to be the cornerstone of ur emotional state
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:45): or if ur identity is tied to PUA.  when times are good, u feel like God
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:45): when theyre not good, ur likely to question a lot of things
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:45): disclaimer: not saying thats how things are for u
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:45): It's more just a physical exhaustion. I'm going out too much and not giving myself time to introspect
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 13:45): yeah, all good
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 13:46) (1x <3): I'm gonna kill whatever fucking baby is making that horrible racket outside my door

Mark (2013-11-11 15:05): this is what i use http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Nitrocore-Ultimate-Chocolate/dp/B002DYJ07A

Nate (2013-11-11 15:07): Was feeling experimental.  Number closed this tall black woman.  All I could think of was 'death by snoo snoo'.  Woman was huge (not at all fat)

Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 15:31): She's gonna haunt your dreams 
Nate (2013-11-11 15:33) (1x <3): LMAO one of the girls I pinged yesterday got all mad because I mentioned a fortune cookie and she was asian.  Someone needs to take the flagpole out of her ass.
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 15:34): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 15:34): I would have said something like that anyway
Nate (2013-11-11 15:34): I sent her back a history of the fortune cookie, and lied and said it was a Chinese friend who suggested it.
Nate (2013-11-11 15:35): Fortune cookies are about as chinese as fried chicken
Mark (2013-11-11 15:41) (3x <3): she sounds retarded
Nate (2013-11-11 15:41): Yeah, seriously.  How much of an inferiority complex must she have to take that seriously
Nate (2013-11-11 15:42): Also she's got a pretty dumb grasp of history
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 15:43) (2x <3): Ask if she prefers Cream of sum young gai

Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:07): Mmmph
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-11 16:09): Jimmy this might be a little crass
Nate (2013-11-11 16:10): @pippy I can't imagine being much more crass than talking about banging a daughter and mother together
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:11) (1x <3): So, that happened, eh?

Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:31): I understand people not being good at texting and shit, but if you grok the underlying principles, you should be able to come up with your own shit
Nate (2013-11-11 16:31): > but if you grok the underlying principles
Nate (2013-11-11 16:31): Therein lies the issue
Mark (2013-11-11 16:32) (1x <3): but i need to grok back the key
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:32): Especially because it's a pure extension of red pill theory, you don't even have the excuse of your anxiety getting in the way
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:32) (1x <3): I need to give grok back!
Nate (2013-11-11 16:32): The red pill concepts are actually pretty hard to grok
Mark (2013-11-11 16:33) (1x <3): why you no grok key now
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:33) (1x <3): Excuse me, but where is your freaking CHIN?
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:33): @Nate Perhaps you're right
Nate (2013-11-11 16:35): When I sit down to think of things to say in text.  I really don't know how to think, much more so than in person.
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:35): You have your outer game down, but not the inner
Nate (2013-11-11 16:36): quite likely
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:36) (1x <3): There's something going on that's holding you back
Mark (2013-11-11 16:36) (2x <3): you need to eat more mcdonalds
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:36): Maybe you're subconsciouly worried about losing your lead
Nate (2013-11-11 16:36): I know I am
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:36): Or offending them or something
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 16:36): Intestinal game
Nate (2013-11-11 16:36): it's not subconscious
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:37): See, if anything, I'm suffering from the opposite problem
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:37): I have to give myself reasons to like girls
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:38): Rather than just being indifferent or discounting them from the get-go
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:38): Because if all I'm valuing them for is sex, then my investment level is very low, because I know I can get sex easily
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:38): From someone else if not them
Nate (2013-11-11 16:39): It hasn't been that long since I had no success at all.  Spend years like that and it's hard to abandon
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:39): Yeah, I can imagine
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:39): My inner game issues are different than yours
Mark (2013-11-11 16:39) (1x <3): Nate secretly deep down inside you don't believe you deserve hot women
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:39): I
Nate (2013-11-11 16:39): yep
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:40): *I'm harder on myself than anyone else. I barely even care what other people think, but I exaggerate the importance of the standards I hold myself to
Mark (2013-11-11 16:41) (3x <3): you're going to see the best gains if you focus on inner things like: fitness, fashion, career etc
Mark (2013-11-11 16:41) (3x <3): then you'll be convinced you deserve the women you want
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 16:42): Exactly
Phillatio (2013-11-11 16:42): fitness is the main one for me
Phillatio (2013-11-11 16:43): and just generally I need to be less pessimistic 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 16:43): although I'm only really like that privately

Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:03): Ostriches are mammals?

Nate (2013-11-11 17:21): This girl was pretty, but she literally had no personality at all.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:21): Made plans w/ a chick tonight, but last night's chick leaves tmrw and wants to hang out one last time. if i flake it would make it 3 times in a row now

Mark (2013-11-11 17:35) (3x <3): i think she's your type xander
Nate (2013-11-11 17:38): I wonder if she's actually from Nigeria
Nate (2013-11-11 17:41): She would have at least stood a chance if she asked me right after fucking me
Nate (2013-11-11 17:41): well not really, but still
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:45): Nah u should still, troll the hell outta her
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:45) (1x <3): There's an epidemic of gold digging whores
Nate (2013-11-11 17:45): lol I decided to go straight at her
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:47): Dude I am so sad u didn't ask what's in it for u
Phillatio (2013-11-11 17:47): me too
Nate (2013-11-11 17:47): That wasn't what you suggested, although yeah that would have been fun
Nate (2013-11-11 17:48): I could have gotten some nudes out of it at least
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:48) (1x <3): "Ok, i take care of u...u take care of me  ;)"
Mark (2013-11-11 17:48) (1x <3): it's not too late
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:48): "How much for anal" but that would probably lose the account
Jimmyayo (2013-11-11 17:50): She should seriously consider turning tricks 
Phillatio (2013-11-11 17:52): where's somewhere pretty cheap to go with a chick tonight
Phillatio (2013-11-11 17:52): near me in the east village

Nate (2013-11-11 21:06) (1x <3): That was one crazy massage.  45 minutes of it was 4 hands, no towel at all, All 3 girls working that night took turns.
Xander Xone (2013-11-11 22:47): Well, this date is a joke. I'm about to bounce
D-money (2013-11-11 22:49) (1x <3): Remember French girl I asked you guys about whether I should pay for her ticket? She just left. *le sigh

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-12 01:25):  i think its a point too generous but pretty solid
Phillatio (2013-11-12 10:25) (1x <3): definitely too generous below a 5 doesn't really exist to me
Phillatio (2013-11-12 10:25): it doesn't even matter at that point
Phillatio (2013-11-12 10:30): going by this scale I've never been with less than a 6
Phillatio (2013-11-12 10:30): which I tend to rate some of my past unfortunates as 5's
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 10:44): Yeah, some of the pictures seem off, too
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 10:46) (1x <3): Like, some of the 6s seem as if they should be in the 7 category and vice versa
Nate (2013-11-12 10:47): After number closing the snu snu chick yesterday, I realized I'm the ash Ketchum of women. Gotta catch em all
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 10:48) (2x <3): @Mark I like that rack very much
Nate (2013-11-12 10:52): @Xander none of us exactly agree on what a girl is rated
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 10:58): Okay, A E
Nate (2013-11-12 11:25) (2x <3): Anyone want the number for the scam artist girl?
Nate (2013-11-12 11:26) (2x <3): Astou: (646) 240-0448
Marcus (2013-11-12 11:27): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:27): Oh man, this is going to be great
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:27): @Nate Which girl was the scam artist?
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:28): I can't recall
Nate (2013-11-12 11:28): I figure you guys are more evil than me
Nate (2013-11-12 11:28): Black chick who asked me for money yesterday even though we never even met past the 2 mins where I number closed her.  She even flaked on Friday too.
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:29): Was she the snu snu chick?
Nate (2013-11-12 11:29): No, I just met her yesterday
Nate (2013-11-12 11:31): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/c929a3802de50131a94222000ae848a8
Nate (2013-11-12 11:31) (2x <3): Here's the scam artist herself
Nate (2013-11-12 11:33): Although when I say scam artist I'm giving her too much credit
Nate (2013-11-12 11:34): I met her getting breakfast near work
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:41): Gotta respect the hustle
Nate (2013-11-12 11:42): I'd respect it if it wasn't so pathetically transparent "Can I have money"
Nate (2013-11-12 11:42): I respect her persistence though, even after I told her I thought she was full of shit and laughed at her, she said something like "But really, can I borrow money"
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:43): "The only thing you can borrow is my dick"
Nate (2013-11-12 11:44): The last thing I sent her was "I might be persuaded to listen to you more if you sent me nude pics"
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:45): Did she reply to that?
Nate (2013-11-12 11:45): yeah she laughed and said she would send some right away
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 11:48): Tell her to get on that!
Nate (2013-11-12 11:48): Okay
Nate (2013-11-12 12:17): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4443b3902dec0131420a22000aef140c
Nate (2013-11-12 12:18): She's a nasty one
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:19): Oh man, she's asking for a trolling
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:19) (1x <3): I would have been like, "It turns me on when you talk dirty"
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:22) (1x <3): "motha fucka"
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:22): lmao
Nate (2013-11-12 12:22): I was 2 texts ahead, but I sent that anyway
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:22): what a ghetto ass bitch
Nate (2013-11-12 12:22): yeah no kidding
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:22) (1x <3): She's basically just a fucking savage
Nate (2013-11-12 12:23) (1x <3): About as subhuman as you can get
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:24) (2x <3): the girl last night told me she was afraid of black people
Nate (2013-11-12 12:25): oh it's not her blackness that makes her worthless, its her worthlessness
Nate (2013-11-12 12:26): girl from last night sounds like a real winner
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:26) (2x <3): whiner*
Nate (2013-11-12 12:27): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc5OZVvD4Jo
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:27): I can't go out with black girls anymore. we literally have no common ground to meet on
Nate (2013-11-12 12:28) (1x <3): Depends, if they are from the USA, then usually the answer is no.  If they are from other countries they are usually much more normal
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:28): yeah I could see that
Nate (2013-11-12 12:28): Most of the black women I've ever gone out with that didn't suck were from other countries
Nate (2013-11-12 12:29): or I should say did suck...
Nate (2013-11-12 12:29) (1x <3): badum cha
Nate (2013-11-12 12:32): I actually think indians are much worse.  I can't see eye to eye with them at all
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:32): I could see that
Phillatio (2013-11-12 12:32) (1x <3): I like spanish girls and western europeans
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:32): Just look at how much difficulty Indian dudes have
Nate (2013-11-12 12:32): Yeah seriously
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:32): You know that the women are going to be ball busters
Nate (2013-11-12 12:32): yeah but the men there are allowed to beat them
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:34): So why isn't it working?
Nate (2013-11-12 12:34) (1x <3): I dunno, maybe they don't hit hard enough
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 12:34) (4x <3): The middle east seems to have their shit on lockdown
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 12:55) (1x <3): "don't fucking text me again motha fucka"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 12:55) (1x <3): ----> Bro you gotta text her again

Nate (2013-11-12 13:07): Well right now I could end that, or keep texting other stuff
Nate (2013-11-12 13:08): Or one of you could also send shit too :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:09): "You the one who's talking" Captain Obvious over here
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:11): Maybe i'll text her "hey i found your # on a bathroom wall. M or F?"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:11): "I can pay very handsomly fyi"

Mark (2013-11-12 13:22): what kind of lips are we talking about here
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:22): Cunt lips, of course
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:23): The meatier the better
Mark (2013-11-12 13:24) (2x <3): this one chick i was with had the flappiest lips, i thought she was going to fly off into the night after we were done
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:25) (1x <3): You were going down on her and she was basically slapping your head left and right
Nate (2013-11-12 13:25): @Xander of course
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:26) (2x <3): I've noticed that I attract a disproportionate amount of cute hipster-ish girls on Tinder. I think that's telling me that I should move to Brooklyn
Mark (2013-11-12 13:26): it's the glasses
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:26): Well, and the fact that I am actually a secret hipster
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:26): You'll get your fair share of feminists 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:27) (3x <3): Lol "secret"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:28): I've been w/ 2 black chicks, both were completely nuts in the sack
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:28): But also didn't have the freshest smelling poosies 
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:29): You should have made them properly douche beforehand
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:30): The horse barn was already in use =(
Phillatio (2013-11-12 13:31): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-12 13:31) (2x <3): I feel like asians have the freshest smelling poooooooosie
Phillatio (2013-11-12 13:31): not that I care much. I kind of like a smelly little skank

Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:54) (1x <3): I have a date with his kneecaps
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:54): In my experience about 30-40% of the guys that come to these meetups are somewhat normal and worth meeting, talking shop with
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 13:54): The rest are Nilay x 10
Mark (2013-11-12 13:56): i have yet to meet the mythical nilay
Marcus (2013-11-12 13:56) (1x <3): Mark u r better off not meeting him
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 13:57): @Mark I ran into him at Phebe's this weekend...

Nate (2013-11-12 15:34): maybe Leticia saved her mother's life or something
Nate (2013-11-12 15:37): "Sounds like you need a bag of sunflower seeds" - final answer?

Nate (2013-11-12 16:42): I know I can find bars to not card on Tuesday, Solas, one near me, etc
Marcus (2013-11-12 16:45): Go early anywhere

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-12 18:15): can i get a TL;DR on that book.  I can get it off the site but why was it recommended in the chat?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 18:16): I think we were discussing good books to read related to behavioral science
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-12 18:16): right right, but if "What Every Body is Saying" by Joe Navaro is a good primer on body language
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-12 18:16): what would this book be?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-12 18:16): something to get you more in the moment?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 18:18): Probably best answered by one of the guys who's read it  =\
Mark (2013-11-12 18:18): Behavioral psychology
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 18:19): Check out the intro chapter, it's available on amazon

Marcus (2013-11-12 21:29): Nate she's not real, she doesn't exist
Nate (2013-11-12 21:29) (2x <3): but middle eastern chicks are hot as fuck.  Go out to brooklyn and check out the lebanese chicks and you'll see why they force them to get married
Marcus (2013-11-12 21:30): I guess I should
Nate (2013-11-12 21:31): my friend used to have a father that had a store on their area, and would complain they were all 10's and all married

Xander Xone (2013-11-12 22:03): Guess I'm bouncing to somewhere else with this chick
Nate (2013-11-12 22:04): I guess the date can't be that bad if you're bouncing somewhere else
Jimmyayo (2013-11-12 22:08): It is so freaking cold...my nips feel like they can cut glass
Nate (2013-11-12 22:11): I hate cold
Xander Xone (2013-11-12 22:45): I'm at sly Fox right now. How did this happen

Xander Xone (2013-11-13 09:43): The icing on top was passing by kitty sun on my way into the 9th street PATH station and her doing a double take
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 09:45) (3x <3): You mean the Closers' neighborhood bicycle?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 09:52): OP

Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:05): I've been considering taking a short break
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:05): from gaming
Nate (2013-11-13 11:05): To be fair I don't succeed at that either, mainly because I suck at taking pictures
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:06) (1x <3): I think I need to get out of this and work on some internal issues
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:06): Omg, I'm so over this shit ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8a7871f02eab0131a94322000ae848a8

Mark (2013-11-13 11:25) (1x <3): why am i not surprised he gets flaked on a shit ton
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:26): I love how now he's admitting that his game is bad
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:26): After being so presumptuous the other day
Mark (2013-11-13 11:27) (2x <3): his idol gol isnt around so hes dropping the fake alpha mask
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:30): any of you guys ever try meditation 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:30): I used to do it all the time
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:30): I'm thinking of getting back into it
Mark (2013-11-13 11:30): yes went to a silent retreat upstate a few months ago
Mark (2013-11-13 11:30): was intense and awesome
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:30): intenseeeee
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:30): @Phillatio I've done some transcendental meditation
Mark (2013-11-13 11:30) (1x <3): like buddhas vagina
Mark (2013-11-13 11:31): transcendental is a good way to get into it, but dont pay them a dime, theyre crooks
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:31): @Mark I don't pay for anything
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:31): oh I've heard of that
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:31): I checked my bank account last night
Mark (2013-11-13 11:31): im not worried about you xander
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:31): 0.00 dollars
Mark (2013-11-13 11:32): hey at least its positive
Mark (2013-11-13 11:32): well is 0 positive idk
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:32): yes
Mark (2013-11-13 11:32): some metaphysical shit right there
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:32): Asian math questions
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:32): #AsianMathQuestions
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 11:32): http://replygif.net/i/672.gif
Mark (2013-11-13 11:32): this is like philosophy bs
Nate (2013-11-13 11:33) (1x <3): if your bank account reaches 0, and noones there to see it, is it really empty?
Mark (2013-11-13 11:33): but yeah i highly recommend the retreats
Mark (2013-11-13 11:33): on the other hand, why meditate when you have lsd/shrooms
Nate (2013-11-13 11:34): I want to do shrooms, but I've never had a safe opportunity
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:34): well lots of reasons
Mark (2013-11-13 11:34): a dose of psychedelics have been compared to roughly 100 hours of meditation
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:34): but that's obvious
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:34): the effects aren't lasting
Mark (2013-11-13 11:34): you write them down
Mark (2013-11-13 11:34):  record yourself
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:34) (1x <3): Yeah dudes, let's do some DMT
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:34): yes ^
Mark (2013-11-13 11:35): dmt is the only shit that has frightened me
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:35): I'm in for that
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:35): It frightened me too. I must be truly masochistic
Mark (2013-11-13 11:35): i shat my pants but the expedrience was so interesting i wanted to do it again immediately
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:36): It also doesn't have any lasting effects. Your body completely processes it
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:36): So no worries about holes in your brain or whatevs
Mark (2013-11-13 11:36): im pretty sure i had ptsd for a week or two after from dmt
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:36): well I've never done it
Mark (2013-11-13 11:36): o snap
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:36): done ever other fucking thing
Mark (2013-11-13 11:37) (2x <3): psychedelics are a good test of how strong your inner frame is
Mark (2013-11-13 11:37) (2x <3): i have friends with lots of insecurities and they could never touch those things
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 11:39): @Mark Pippy said the exact same thing when he was on a LSD trip a few mo's ago
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:39): lsd didn't effect me badely
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:39): and I took a shit ton
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 11:39): And also that, who you're tripping with makes a big impact 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:39): I did it alone
Mark (2013-11-13 11:40): im fine doing it alone or with other trippers
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 11:40): So then, you must have a healthy inner frame 
Mark (2013-11-13 11:40): basically, ill do it anywhere anytime
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:40): yea
Mark (2013-11-13 11:40): i usually like to do it outdoors but indoors is fine too
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:42): environment is pretty key
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:53): wow groupme
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:53): way to be a shit show

Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:54): we need a closers website
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:54) (1x <3): http://closers.com/
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:54): is available 
Nate (2013-11-13 11:55): really?
Nate (2013-11-13 11:55): probably for sale for 20k.  Let the finance guys buy it
Mark (2013-11-13 11:56) (1x <3): would rather buy a dominican boy for 20k
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:56): and make him your personal gimp
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:56): get medieval on his ass
Nate (2013-11-13 11:56): I'd rather have an 18 yr old dominican girl
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:57): fuck that 
Mark (2013-11-13 11:57) (1x <3): ok
Phillatio (2013-11-13 11:57) (1x <3): if I'm gonna go young I might as well say a 14 y/o
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:57): Why settle for either? Get a dominican hermaphrodite
Mark (2013-11-13 11:58) (1x <3): your own personal meatspin
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 11:59) (1x <3): @Mark Thanks for making me laugh out loud at work, you bunghole
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 12:01): So I missed LSD/DMT, hermaphrodites and meatspins
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 12:01): nice
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:03): ugh 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:03): I forgot how gross meatspin was
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:03): should never look up shit mark says
Mark (2013-11-13 12:04): youre welcome
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 12:04): Meatspin? Goatse is my laptop's background
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:05): I stole someones myspace layout one time and used the same background image from the same source 
Nate (2013-11-13 12:05) (1x <3): when I think of meatspin I think of shwarma
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:05) (1x <3): and they changed it to goatse 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 12:05): it was pretty hilarious

Nate (2013-11-13 12:13): I keep bouncing back and forth between good advice and trolling
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 12:17): Good trolling provides wisdom too
Nate (2013-11-13 12:17): I just texted a girl "I hear the stress in your text, and I want to turn it around and smack it in the ass"
Mark (2013-11-13 12:18): cant... stop... trolling
Mark (2013-11-13 12:18) (1x <3): wheres the off switch
Nate (2013-11-13 12:19): There is no off switch, there is only a volume control that goes from 10 to 11
Mark (2013-11-13 12:19) (1x <3): should i work out or eat pizza
Mark (2013-11-13 12:19): help me decide
Nate (2013-11-13 12:19): work out while eating pizza

Nate (2013-11-13 13:34): "I don't care how bad your profile is, or if your stupid.  I want your dick"
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 13:37): @Mark Do you actually want to fuck her?
Nate (2013-11-13 13:38): I'm willing to bet she will be really easy to tease, and fuck
Nate (2013-11-13 13:38): You will have to suffer through her bullshit words tho
Mark (2013-11-13 13:38): her sass makes me hard
Mark (2013-11-13 13:38): even though shes like a 6

Phillatio (2013-11-13 13:39): if she wasn't a fatty
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 13:39): triceps/biceps tell whats underneath dat blouse

Mark (2013-11-13 13:40): idk
Mark (2013-11-13 13:40) (1x <3): i just want to shove popsicle stick sculptures up her ass
Nate (2013-11-13 13:40) (1x <3): That's more like a 7.5, except of course I bet that's not a recent photo
Phillatio (2013-11-13 13:41): 7 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 13:41): but just barely

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 13:47): #Smash or Pass
Nate (2013-11-13 13:48): she's going to be more annoying to talk to than the bitch
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:09): Radio silence
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:09): dead air*
Nate (2013-11-13 14:09): God I hate women, another flake
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:10): don't take this the wrong way but something to consider is that it might be something you're doing
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:10): *gasp* But that's... that's MISOGYNY!
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:10): thoughts
Nate (2013-11-13 14:10): The thought occurred to me
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:11): I mean idk how you would fix that
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:11): I wonder what it is
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:11): Where along the interaction are you losing them?
Nate (2013-11-13 14:12): She said she has a training that's going to run late, has to be at work at 7, is signing on an apartment this week, and had a recent breakup
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:12): she offer a time to resched.?
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:13) (1x <3): damn she had 5 excuses for you
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:13): LOL RIGHT
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:13): Not a good sign
Nate (2013-11-13 14:13) (1x <3): She initially said maybe we'll run into each other in a few months.  I said no, here is what is going to happen.  I'm going to contact you saturday, and either Sunday or next week we are getting a drink.  I won't take no for an answer.
Nate (2013-11-13 14:13): She said "Damn you are persistent. Okay"
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:14) (1x <3): I like that
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:14): Are you leaving enough mystery?
Nate (2013-11-13 14:15): We don't really know much about each other except occupation.
Nate (2013-11-13 14:16): Conversation we had when we met didn't really talk about many details.  More fun stuff
Nate (2013-11-13 14:16): That and sexuality.
Nate (2013-11-13 14:18): I do think my daygame conversation after the opening needs work still
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:18) (2x <3): All I need to get down is opening
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:18): Approaching and opening
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:19): same ^
Nate (2013-11-13 14:20): I wish I had your problem
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:20): well all I need do is get my feet moving
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:20): opening is fine
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:20): I don't move
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:21) (2x <3): Xander, have u done Grand Cental Friday Rush Hour
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:22): or Phil?
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:22): I have not
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:22) (1x <3): I've never done grand central
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:23): Looks like I'm headed to Brooklyn tonight, since my Tinder date for tonight texted me yesterday having to reschedule
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:24) (1x <3): Grand Central Station on a Friday? I give it two dicks up
Nate (2013-11-13 14:24) (1x <3): Poor you, girl rescheduled so you'll have to have sex
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:24): yeah man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:24): mean
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:24): Grandf Central is nervewracking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:24): ive done rush hour a handful of times
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:25): but its good, challenging. a lot of traffic and moving sets.  there is the underground cafeteria so if u feel like u fuc.ked up the main spot, just go down there
Nate (2013-11-13 14:25): It's a little bit harder because you're virtually guaranteed that everyone is going somewhere
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:25): true true
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:25) (1x <3): It's all fun and games until some fat fuck rolls up and blows out your set
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:25): i think it helps take the edge of whatever anxiety u may feel approaching
Nate (2013-11-13 14:25) (1x <3): Other than that though it's all just mind games
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:25): anyways, thats my $0.02
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:26): one positive affirmation i tell myself i got from RSD Foundations
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:26): I would like to run game there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:26): "Fuc.k what anyone else things, my ggame is 10/10"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:26): yeah its obviously not 10/10 but realize u prob have enough info experience to handle the set
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:26): ur mind may not think it at the time as it envisions the worst scenario but ud be surprised at what it can pull off when it comes down to it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:27): Nate
Other than that though it's all just mind games
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:27): agreed, 100%
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:29): Anyway, Nate, why do you think you're getting flakes
Nate (2013-11-13 14:30): I don't know.  I think a symptom of it is that girls don't chase me like they tend to do with you
Nate (2013-11-13 14:31): I know I still have inner game issues
Nate (2013-11-13 14:32): I think whatever the actual reason for the flakes, it's probably the same reason I have trouble hooking 9's
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:33): Everyone has trouble hooking 9s unless they're running celebrity game
Nate (2013-11-13 14:33): Honestly I don't really know what is going on
Nate (2013-11-13 14:33): probably not 1 thing
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:34): My guess is that you're somehow displaying neediness or insecurity
Nate (2013-11-13 14:34): Certainly possible
Nate (2013-11-13 14:35): The girl on Tuesday most definitely ditched me for that reason
Nate (2013-11-13 14:38): Not really sure what my action plan is to fix the issues tho
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:39): I'll have to think about it
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:39): Damnit, I'm tired of seeing overweight girls on Tinder who would be super hot if they lost weight
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:41) (1x <3): its a damn shame actually
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:43) (1x <3): Just another reminder of how godless this universe is
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 14:44): @Phillatio I think my phone charger got left at your house, since Nate was using it on his phone when I left
Nate (2013-11-13 14:52): Ugh I swear the last couple weeks I'm sliding back to sanderp territory.  I don't feel like I did anything different either
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:54): could be just a phase man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 14:54): unless ur getting consistent negative feedback
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:56): I'm pretty sure its just a phase
Nate (2013-11-13 14:56): The chick on Tuesday was all from bad texting
Nate (2013-11-13 14:57): way too needy
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:57) (2x <3): most people aren't even aware of when they suck
Phillatio (2013-11-13 14:57): food for thought
Nate (2013-11-13 15:16): Still not the happiest notion that I suck, but could be worse.
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 15:17): You don't suck...
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 15:23): I'm starting to feel overwhelmed again. There are too many women to keep track of...

Xander Xone (2013-11-13 15:52): I'm trying to remember who marbles12 is...
Nate (2013-11-13 15:53): He never made enough of an impression for me to distinguish him from other random ppl
Phillatio (2013-11-13 15:58): I know him
Phillatio (2013-11-13 15:58): he's a cool guy
Mark (2013-11-13 16:01): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/a0f5cc102ed40131a94322000ae848a8

Nate (2013-11-13 16:02): and a 12 in crazy
Mark (2013-11-13 16:03): i dont know how to talk to people this stupid
Nate (2013-11-13 16:04): But hotness
Mark (2013-11-13 16:04): 90% of sentences she writes ends with an exclamation mark
Nate (2013-11-13 16:05): yeah she's perky
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:07): More like manic
Nate (2013-11-13 16:07): probably an energizer bunny in the sack
Nate (2013-11-13 16:07): also probably killed her parent
Nate (2013-11-13 16:07): s
Mark (2013-11-13 16:10): im like dumbing down my messages to her

Mark (2013-11-13 16:19): ha
Nate (2013-11-13 16:20) (3x <3): @Xander yeah you were on your date and AE was asking for you, so I gave him the link to tinderlines.com
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:20): You know, most of those lines are terrible and cheesy. I doubt he was able to pick out the few gems
Nate (2013-11-13 16:20): I do
Nate (2013-11-13 16:21) (1x <3): Aint I a stinker?
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:21): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:22): Looks like everyone else's troll game has vastly improved in here
Nate (2013-11-13 16:22) (2x <3): I thought about giving him your line, but that's proprietary Xandercorp info only for use by Closers
Mark (2013-11-13 16:23) (4x <3): no line in existence can save his beta ass
Phillatio (2013-11-13 16:23): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 16:23): pretty much
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:24) (1x <3): Didn't he mention doing MMA the other day? Talk about incongruent behavior
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:24): Unless he was lying
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 16:24): watching UFC = doing MMA
Mark (2013-11-13 16:27): yeah i bet he grapples with sweaty men
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:03): Always so much comedic gold from the other chat
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:11): The amount of beta in GayLife lately is astounding
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:11): I can't handle it
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:11): its bringing me down 
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:12): I'm getting off on it though
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:12): It's making me haaaaard
Nate (2013-11-13 17:12): I'm feeling better about myself by comparing myself to them
Mark (2013-11-13 17:12): thought i was the only one with a stiffy
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:13): I've been sporting some wood for a while now
Nate (2013-11-13 17:13): I did have a massage place lock its doors so the girls could all take turns jacking me off, so it could be worse
Mark (2013-11-13 17:14) (1x <3): come again?
Nate (2013-11-13 17:14): yes
Mark (2013-11-13 17:14): where is this place you speak of
Mark (2013-11-13 17:14): not that i have any interest in going
Nate (2013-11-13 17:14): 2nd ave between 34th and 35th
Mark (2013-11-13 17:14) (2x <3): brb
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:15): Wow, thanks for the info!
Nate (2013-11-13 17:15): They were all laughing with each other that they did me before
Nate (2013-11-13 17:15): This isn't a place that does them either
Nate (2013-11-13 17:15): FYI none of the girls are what you might call good looking
Nate (2013-11-13 17:16): still fun having them call me the king
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:16): I somehow missed this before
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:17): I think you mentioned getting a massage
Nate (2013-11-13 17:17): yeah I mentioned all 3 girls working that night took turns massaging me, for a good chunk of time 2 at once
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:18): yeah he's told me the whole story
Nate (2013-11-13 17:19): well now I have
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:19): massage game recognized
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:19): I would totally be down for going there
Nate (2013-11-13 17:20): it's actually kind of overwhelming to the senses to have one girl massaging you and one girl rubbing your private parts
Mark (2013-11-13 17:20): i want a real massage though
Mark (2013-11-13 17:20): like a proper one
Mark (2013-11-13 17:20): and then i want them to fuck me
Nate (2013-11-13 17:20): I went there for a real massage
Nate (2013-11-13 17:20): lol
Nate (2013-11-13 17:21): They are fairly old asian women, so I think I'll stick to the hand jobs and maybe at some point a blowjob
Nate (2013-11-13 17:21): decent massages tho, which is why I went there
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:22): uh 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:22): well 
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:22) (3x <3): well I would still want to do it
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:22) (1x <3): even if they do look like my asian grandma
Mark (2013-11-13 17:23): how much did you tip
Nate (2013-11-13 17:23): about 40%
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:23): how much is it?
Nate (2013-11-13 17:23): I felt really good
Nate (2013-11-13 17:24): Well I had a 90 minute massage, 45+ minutes of which was 4 hands, and it was $104
Nate (2013-11-13 17:24): normal hour massage is around 50 I think
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:25): hm
Mark (2013-11-13 17:25): i wonder how much it is with attractive women
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:25): https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=nyc+trigger+point+therapy&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:25): :D
Nate (2013-11-13 17:25): yeah I wouldn't mind attractive women :)
Mark (2013-11-13 17:26) (1x <3): xander get that legitimate massage shit out of here
Nate (2013-11-13 17:28): if you can find a legit asian massage parlor that doesn't charge a lot more than I'm paying, I can try my magic there
Nate (2013-11-13 17:29): mainly went there cause it was cheap and close
Nate (2013-11-13 17:32): Xander...
Nate (2013-11-13 17:32): > Good Man
Nate (2013-11-13 17:32): rewarding cowards
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:32) (1x <3): I can't stop trolling...
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:32) (1x <3): I don't even care about helping them any more
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:40): oh lookie lookie portia coming in for my cookies
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:40): she texted me

Mark (2013-11-13 17:44): something tells me phil is good
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 17:44): Now, if this was Total Annihilation, that would be a different story
Mark (2013-11-13 17:44): unless he went to the tournaments for the hot women
Phillatio (2013-11-13 17:44): yeah no I played against a bunch of koreans in cali

Mark (2013-11-13 18:20) (1x <3): he was talking about starcraft
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 18:21) (1x <3): That is not always a bad idea -  if u feel like ur identity is getting too wrapped up in pickup
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 18:21): I don't do anything other than work and skirt chase

D-money (2013-11-13 18:26) (1x <3): @phil I felt like that a bit, like when I hang out with girls for longer, there isn't that much to talk about in terms of my other activities, since you know, you can't tell them you spend 80% o your free time dating
Phillatio (2013-11-13 18:27): this is true
Mark (2013-11-13 18:27) (2x <3): my hobbies include pussy, and the accumulation thereof
Phillatio (2013-11-13 18:27): I usually just lie

Mark (2013-11-13 18:52): listen to this while youre slitting your wrists
Mark (2013-11-13 18:52): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQMzxiEQiyw
Nate (2013-11-13 18:52): I wish, too bad I'm incapable of that
Nate (2013-11-13 18:53): Die brain cells, die!
Nate (2013-11-13 18:55): Seems like the perfect night for a mental breakdown
Nate (2013-11-13 19:16) (1x <3): Sandeep, sucking the soul of will daily
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 19:19) (1x <3): Hahaha seriously...sigh
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 19:20) (1x <3): Dammit I feel so bad for the kid
Nate (2013-11-13 19:20): I take an occasional day to let off steam and vent.  He just sucks will :(
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 19:21): I wonder if he's aware of his own behavior/attitude and how obvious it is to others
Jimmyayo (2013-11-13 19:21): I'm guessing not
Nate (2013-11-13 19:24): He's not
Nate (2013-11-13 19:25): I was with Xander trying to help him, and I started trying to show him how to walk.  He had no idea what and why I was telling him
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:26) (1x <3): He walks like a fucking fruit cake
Nate (2013-11-13 19:26): Yes, I demonstrated how he walked to him
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:26): Flaming*
Nate (2013-11-13 19:26): I was pretty brutal
Nate (2013-11-13 19:27): You know what he needs, to get into a real fight
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:27) (1x <3): He needs fight club
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:30) (2x <3): I got into a lot of fights in middle school
Nate (2013-11-13 19:30): I fought for my life in high school
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:31): Yeah we more fought over me calling their mom a lesbian or something
Nate (2013-11-13 19:32): I fought 30 to 1, 8 to 1, 6 to 1, 3 to 1, 2 to 1, guys with knives, guys much bigger than me
Nate (2013-11-13 19:33): Not really a side of myself I've had to show for a very long time
Marcus (2013-11-13 19:33) (1x <3): Most of my flights were in middle school.
Marcus (2013-11-13 19:34): Fun times
Nate (2013-11-13 19:34): Had those too, they regretted it
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:34): Remind me not to get into a fight with you Nate
Nate (2013-11-13 19:35): hehe, it's been a long time since I got serious
Nate (2013-11-13 19:39) (3x <3): Last time was in my first year of college.  There was this guy on my floor who was like 6'3".  Big guy, and I was still really thin at the time.  Thought he could intimidate me because he outweighed me by about 90 lbs.  Choked him until he almost passed out and chucked him down a steep hill.  Good times.
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:42): It's easier being tall people don't usually try to mess with you
Nate (2013-11-13 19:43): Well in high school I was a good 5 inches shorter until I grew
Nate (2013-11-13 19:43): Also people on street didn't really care so much about that
Nate (2013-11-13 19:43): Remember this big black dude from my school came in with a big gash on his face he got in the neighborhood outside my school
Nate (2013-11-13 19:45): Also they generally attacked people for the slight of being white
Phillatio (2013-11-13 19:46): I'm curious about what you looked like back then
Nate (2013-11-13 19:47) (4x <3): 140lbs and dead sexy
Nate (2013-11-13 19:48): I was a very different person back then
Nate (2013-11-13 19:49): There was another guy on my floor in my first year of college who was about 6ft4 and he was afraid of me
Nate (2013-11-13 19:49): That felt awesome
Nate (2013-11-13 19:49): I mellowed out alot
Nate (2013-11-13 19:49): Rarely every talk about this
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:50): yeah man wtf
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:50): i just caught up in the chat.  Nate that is a very stark contrast to how you present yourself
Nate (2013-11-13 19:50): @pippy think of it like being in combat, because it was
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:51): do u think that left u with any hangups?  did it make u better in some ways?
Nate (2013-11-13 19:51): That's because since I left new york the first time I haven't had to be that person anymore
Nate (2013-11-13 19:51): I think it ruined my childhood
Nate (2013-11-13 19:51): or at least the latter half of it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:51): yeah true that
Nate (2013-11-13 19:52): It's one of the reasons I had so much trouble adjusting with women.  I genuinely had a form of ptsd
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:52): adjusting?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:52):  so
Nate (2013-11-13 19:52): Connecting
Nate (2013-11-13 19:53): bleh I should stop talking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:54): all good bro
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:54): it's not where u from, but where u pay rent
Nate (2013-11-13 19:55): It's another life
Nate (2013-11-13 19:56): Haven't lived there for a very long time.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 19:57): cheers
Nate (2013-11-13 19:59): Although if I think about it like this, I can remember the details like it was yesterday.  I can remember the sound of the basketball one of the kids was bouncing behind me right before the 6 of them attacked, and honk of the cars as I jumped into traffic to escape them when I cripped one...
Nate (2013-11-13 20:00): That was one time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-13 20:03): its alright man that was a long time ago. you're straight now
Nate (2013-11-13 20:04): I'm cool.  It's more an intellectual exercise now.
Nate (2013-11-13 20:04) (3x <3): Plus my 3ds and pokemon just arrived
Nate (2013-11-13 21:39): dammit I'm sobering up...
Phillatio (2013-11-13 21:54): Dates going well she's in the bathroom
Phillatio (2013-11-13 21:54) (1x <3): She's kinda cute
Phillatio (2013-11-13 21:55): Just caught up Nate you've had a turbulent history
Nate (2013-11-13 21:57):  Yeah
Mark (2013-11-13 22:01) (2x <3): Im smoking out of my vape in my room with my date
Mark (2013-11-13 22:01): Tonights going to be fun
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 23:06): This girl is absolutely insane
Xander Xone (2013-11-13 23:08) (2x <3): And absolutely special
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 02:08) (1x <3): I just came so hard that cars passing by outside burst into flame
Marcus (2013-11-14 08:19): Let me know of anyone wants to grab lunch. @mark I'm up for the sushi buffet
Nate (2013-11-14 09:23) (1x <3): and I'm back.  Nothing like a good meltdown to revive the soul
Phillatio (2013-11-14 09:35) (1x <3): Um what?
Marcus (2013-11-14 09:35): *if anyone
Nate (2013-11-14 09:39): @phil feeling better
Nate (2013-11-14 09:39) (1x <3): got a good workout in too
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 10:02): Yo Mr. Marcus
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 10:02): at lightshow in ur pic
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 10:02) (1x <3): where is that from? The Fountain of Broseidon?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 10:13): Hey Closers
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 10:14) (1x <3): Does anybody want an accountability partner, to do a minimum of 1-2 approaches a day?  Even shitty approaches, doesnt matter
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 10:20): Xander what date was this?  1st? 2nd?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 10:24) (1x <3): OK everybody not all at once now 
Nate (2013-11-14 10:41): Oh Jimmy, so needy. Beta
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 10:41): Hope I don't get fired. Just leaving Brooklyn now
Nate (2013-11-14 10:41): Call in sick
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 10:44): Yikes xandy...
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 10:47) (2x <3): Lol, so of course this girl drops the bomb that she has a boyfriend who is away for 3 weeks on business
Nate (2013-11-14 10:50): Ugh
Mark (2013-11-14 10:51): Which girl
Mark (2013-11-14 10:51) (3x <3): Stab her in the face
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 10:52) (1x <3): Mark....there are alternative means to solve this kind of situation
Nate (2013-11-14 10:53): Good things never come unconditionally
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 10:56): Anorexic
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 10:58): When I was hanging out with her last night, one part of me wanted to take her out, treat her real nice
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 10:58): The other part of me? Wondered what her head would look like on a stick.
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:00) (2x <3): I bet her boyfriend treats her real nice
Mark (2013-11-14 11:00): This is good news
Mark (2013-11-14 11:01) (1x <3): Just fuck her and let her bf deal with her shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:01) (2x <3): I banged her like a little whore
Mark (2013-11-14 11:03): Hes probably some frail malnourished hipster whose spine you can snap in half like a pretzel
Nate (2013-11-14 11:04): What it does mean is she's not the genuine person you thought she was
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:05) (4x <3): most women aren't ^
Nate (2013-11-14 11:05): Yeah I expect too much out of people
Mark (2013-11-14 11:06) (3x <3): Another reason not to committ to a monogamous ltr
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:08): Nah, I have to give her credit for coming clean, at least
Nate (2013-11-14 11:09): does he live with her?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:09) (3x <3): She is genuine, Nate. Genuinely a cum guzzling slut
Nate (2013-11-14 11:09): Well make sure she drinks yours thoroughly
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:11) (1x <3): She said it tasted good
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:13): They don't live together, @Nate
Nate (2013-11-14 11:14): so who cares, as long as it's your cum she's guzzling
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:15): I certainly don't
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:16) (1x <3): I predict that she might even leave him for me, which would be a grievous error on her part
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:16): Yeah...make sure she knows that 
Nate (2013-11-14 11:17): when you're done with her make sure to pass her around
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:20): One of my reg chicks did the same, broke up w/ her bf of 2 yrs after my 3rd date w/ her, but i'm not feeling (too) guilty about it because i told her repeatedly not to do it to get with me
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:21): If the bf is a needy fuck, she'll likely prefer to become your orbiter than stay committed to him 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:23): All is fair as long as ur up front w/ your intentions 
Nate (2013-11-14 11:25): I'm starting to care less about that each day...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 11:25): why
Nate (2013-11-14 11:26) (3x <3): The shitty things women do makes me care a whole lot less about what I do to them
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 11:28): 1) Telling a girl to not leave her bf because you won't commit to her > 2) Letting her believe that you will be there for her if she leaves him
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 11:28): i dont care, there is no equalizing force in the universe and i doubt these hoes care about the collateral damage they sometimes cause
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:29): She's also whacked out of her mind at the moment
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:29): She's on like... 3+ different meds
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 11:29): u done stuck ur dick in crazy
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:30): And getting herself off of some manner of benzodiazepam drug
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:30): She said that she had her first psychotic episode the other day when she halved her dosage...
Mark (2013-11-14 11:31): Sounds like a prime candidate for dissection
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:32) (1x <3): soooo not following dimitri's advice 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:32): I mean... she's actually 89 lbs, not 90. She just weighed herself
Marcus (2013-11-14 11:33): @pippy that picture is pretty lights 2 weeks ago
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:33): I can practically lob her with one arm
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:33): Whoa...height?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:34): 5'5"
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:34): jesus
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:34): Shit
Nate (2013-11-14 11:34): She probably is actually anorexic
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:34): Well, I don't think it's intentional. She doesn't have much of an appetite cuz of her meds, lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:35): There's always a good reason 
Mark (2013-11-14 11:35) (3x <3): RIP mom and dad!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 11:35): Ano's are experts at justifying their physique to friends/family 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:35) (1x <3): I mean, I know a lot about the shit that she's taking
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:36): Wellbutrin suppresses your appetite, because it's a stimulant
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:37): That's the shit they put you on if SSRIs aren't working
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:40): Anyway, for most people, these meds are just going to keep them from dealing with their underlying problems
Nate (2013-11-14 11:40): yeah that's why they invented alchoho;l
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:41): It's like putting a band-aid on a mortal wound
Mark (2013-11-14 11:43): Psychiatrists also like money
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:45): It's not my problem
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:45) (2x <3): That's also what I told her about her bf
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:46): Who the fuck is Nacho Vidal? He seems like a complete herb
Nate (2013-11-14 11:46) (2x <3): He seems to come in when he's drunk, say stupid things, and leave
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:50): You know, Pokemon and these randos from Tinder seem to be oddly similar. In both cases, I just gotta catch 'em all
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:51): I do the same thing but with STDs 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:53): @Money-maker Mark Hey, I asked you for advice last night
Mark (2013-11-14 11:54): Was too stoned last night
Mark (2013-11-14 11:54): Will get back to you today
Mark (2013-11-14 11:55) (1x <3): But you should let me do all the talking. The troll switch is permanently set at 11 with you ha
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:57) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/bc89e7702f7b0131a94222000ae848a8
Phillatio (2013-11-14 11:57): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 11:57): @Mark Case in point
Mark (2013-11-14 11:59): Heheh
Mark (2013-11-14 11:59) (2x <3): Trolling a bipolar girl... Game recognized
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 12:00): I can't stop laughing, hahaha
Mark (2013-11-14 12:01) (2x <3): She swallowed a fistful of meds after reading that first text
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 12:06): Man, I'm enjoying this bullshit far too much. I need to stop enjoying life so much
Nate (2013-11-14 12:07): I have to learn to be more like the troll master
Mark (2013-11-14 12:07): You two. Have babies
Mark (2013-11-14 14:11): http://therationalmale.com/2011/08/26/buffers/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:12): Go on...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:14): http://pagesix.com/2013/11/14/silverman-finalizes-divorce-after-simon-cowell-affair/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:14): Beta of the Year, candidate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:15): No details were given but The Post reported in August that Lauren 
will get about $2 million, half of what was believed to be a $4 million 
pre-nuptial agreement.TMZ reported Thursday that one of the 
settlement conditions would require Cowell to pay Andrew Silverman a 
$50,000 penalty if he goes near the Silvermans’ 7-year-old son, Adam.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:15): The agreement also says that Andrew Silverman cannot badmouth Cowell
 to Adam. Lauren and Silverman agreed to prevent Adam from calling 
anyone other than them “mother” or “father,” TMZ said – meaning that 
Cowell cannot be treated as the boy’s father.The cause of the divorce has been changed from adultery to “broken down 
irretrievably.” And Lauren gets $3,000 a month in child support, TMZ 
said.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:16): Page Six’s Emily Smith reported in August that Cowell and the 
cuckolded Andrew Silverman, who had been close friends, cleared the air 
at a meeting before Lauren signed the divorce papers.“Cowell 
wanted a face-to-face meeting to clear the air and make sure Andrew 
wouldn’t speak out about him. No money changed hands, but Simon made 
Andrew feel good, said
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:16): he feels bad about the situation, he will take care of everything and he hoped they will remain friends,” a source said.
Mark (2013-11-14 14:18): he has a reputation to protect
Mark (2013-11-14 14:18): simon cowell is more alpha than all of us put together
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:23): (sigh)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:23): well, that's just your opinion, man
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:24) (1x <3): Uh oh... Who let A E into our chat?
Mark (2013-11-14 14:24): haha
Mark (2013-11-14 14:24): youre free to disagree pippy, but be prepared to argue your case
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:26): http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thats-just-like-your-opinion-man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:26): http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/204031/the-more-you-know-o.gif
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:28): Wait, what?
Mark (2013-11-14 14:28): im confused as well
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:29): The cuckolded guy, Andrew Silverman is the beta of the year, if anyone
Mark (2013-11-14 14:29): yup
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:29): You have it backwards
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:29): never said Simon was beta
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:30): was quoting a line from The Big Lebowski
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:30): I mean, Simon basically just cuckolded him and got away with it too
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:30): exactly
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:30): What a boss
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:30): is simon a girl
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:31) (2x <3): I'm not up on my pop culture knowledge
Mark (2013-11-14 14:31): no but hes british
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:31): mind-boggling that Silverman's ex wifey gets $2MM and $3k a month
Mark (2013-11-14 14:31): thats a pittance 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:31): Seriously
Mark (2013-11-14 14:31): smart men always request a prenup
Mark (2013-11-14 14:31): smart rich* men
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:31): I'm going to get a prenup regardless
Mark (2013-11-14 14:31): yep
Mark (2013-11-14 14:32) (3x <3): slut insurance
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:32): I'm going to get a post-op
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:33): seriously adultery should negate any sort of alimony bullshit 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:34) (1x <3): Adultery: Legally negligible if you're a woman but financially ruinous if you're a man
Mark (2013-11-14 14:34): unless you live in the middle east
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:34): do u guys ever consider getting married down the road
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:34): They're alpha to a fault. That's why they're stuck in the middle ages
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:34): or possible having mini Xanders or mini Marks at one point
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:35) (1x <3): Man: He cheated because he's a pig.
Woman: She cheated because she wasn't getting her needs met by her husband.
Mark (2013-11-14 14:35) (2x <3): im not against cloning myself
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:36): I'm fairly certain I'm going to get married at some point
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:36): eventually
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:36): it would be kinda nice to have enough money where u can spawn a few sons with various women and be able to raise them in a way u see fit
Phillatio (2013-11-14 14:36) (1x <3): yeah well move to the middle east where adulteresses lose their hands
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:37): I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone.
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:37): There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:38): I see the worst in people, Pippy. I don't have to look past seeing them to get all I need.
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:38): I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
Mark (2013-11-14 14:40): I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:43): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:43): I see the worst in people, Pippy. I don't have to look past seeing them to get all I need.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:44): lol idk what to say. 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:44): One day, I'm going to come in your house when you're sleeping and cut your throat
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:44): lollllllll
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:45): Googled what xander said
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:45): felt better about the situ
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:45): u guys ever seen Eastern Promises or A History of Violence
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:45): right up your alley
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:46): I've seen A History of Violence
Mark (2013-11-14 14:47): i am a history of violence
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:47): Eastern Prom. is same director and Viggo Mortenson
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:47) (1x <3): It's a semi-biographical depiction of Mark's years before getting into game
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:47): good date movie, if you're having one of those "movie nights"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:47): ^ Eastern Prmises
Mark (2013-11-14 14:48): time to go to the gym
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:48): I watched a bunch of It's Always Sunny with that skinny bitch last night
Mark (2013-11-14 14:48): gonna get all violent on those pink dumbells
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:51): Xander u just trolled me hard bro
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:51): that diatribe above, i thought it was coming from u and not There Will be blood lo
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:52): Well, it might as well have come from me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:54): oh come on man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:55): even if that quote applied, it reminds me of something i read that the worst you see  in other people is a reflection of what one sees in himself...some shit like that
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:56) (2x <3): I used to believe that, but now I know that most people suck
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:56): It's not even an emotional thing, it's just a fact
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:56): I automatically screen for people who don't suck
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:56): suck, how
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:56): im not disputing, btu whts the criteria
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:57) (1x <3): They are unwilling to take control of their own destinies, they are close-minded and petty, they are envious, jealous and materialistic little imps, spiritually speaking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:57): yeah, that first one bothers me the ost
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:58): *most
Nate (2013-11-14 14:58): worse, they are unwilling to take control of their own destiny, and blame others for that failure
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:58): Who wants to admit that they suck? And will continue to do so until they get better
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 14:58): not many
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 14:59): Those striving toward being an ubermensch
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:00): so what about child-hood/school friends that dont make that "cut"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:00): i have a couple....great guys and all. i went thru a period of not understanding their mentality
Phillatio (2013-11-14 15:00): I know I suck
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:00): As much as it pains me, I have to leave them behind. When they're unwilling to make any sort of effort, that is
Phillatio (2013-11-14 15:01): and know basically nothing about the wrold
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:01): but thn again, true friends are hard to find...or at least ones with 15+ years of friendship
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:01): My friend who lives in Princeton, NJ, I have known him since we were 2 years old. He's completely stuck and unwilling to grabs the reins of his own life
Nate (2013-11-14 15:01): I have some of those, although I don't see them often anymore
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:02): Every once in a while I send him a "ping text", lol
Nate (2013-11-14 15:02): I saw one last week, first time I'd see him since last winter
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:04): Most of my friends from the SF Bay area are little more than human garbage, objectively speaking
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:05): Despite whatever sentimentality I have about them
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:07) (1x <3): I used to play a ton of Magic: the Gathering, and that's where I met most of my friends in the Bay
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:08): I befriended socially competent guys, and some of them could even be considered "alphas", but they aren't going anywhere in life and have no real aspirations to
Phillatio (2013-11-14 15:08): people like that annoy me
Phillatio (2013-11-14 15:09): and I can't fucking understand that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:09): yeah, i went thru a similar phase
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:09): then again, when ur on a spring break trip, and those same guys know ur life story and would go over to ur Mom's house to shovel the snow out of her driveway
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:10): I mean, it's a great game, even if it's nerdy as hell, but games like that attract people who are into escapism
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:10): i kinda reeled it in, less judgmental or try to.  still sucks tho when they become all betafied to a bitchy girl and they cancel on those same spring break trips to not piss her off
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:10): I'm not even being judgmental, it's just that I can't be around that sort of person because it starts negatively affecting me
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:12) (1x <3): At least when I'm wasting my life playing Pokemon or Super Smash Bros, it's because I'm decompressing from work and Game
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:13): The Magic playing is like a self-supporting ecosystem where you can avoid facing real life challenges
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:13): Because most of the guys there are running away from things too
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:15): You can focus on building really complex decks and honing strategies and get completely lost in that world. Playing against others provides that competitive outlet where you feel like something is actually at stake

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:17): ya Xander ur comment reminded me of that
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 15:18): Sounds like the same can be said of most rpg/mmorpg games 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:18): Naturally
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 15:19): Pippy 
"still sucks tho when they become all betafied to a bitchy girl and they cancel on those same spring break trips to not piss her off"

It may suck, but you don't know if your buddy is perfect happy w/ that situ
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:19): Ignorance is bliss, eh
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:19): "But things were going so well! Why did she leave meeeee!?"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:20): It may suck, but you don't know if your buddy is perfect happy w/ that situ
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:20): Oh yeah, Jimmym, they usually are not
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:20): i actually tried "unplugging" a couple buddies who needed it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:20): but ultimately, did not work
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:20) (1x <3): and spoke to a larger flaw of tryign to save people that dont wanna be saved, so yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:21): You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:21) (1x <3): And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:21): ya ya for sure. learned that the hard way lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:21): even my buddy who was in a 2-month long dry spell in his relationship, with his girl beign caught by us on a date with another guy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:22): and who was trapped ina  lease with her
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:22): could not bring it upon himself to wake up fully
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:22): Hurray for Matrix quotes
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:22): So cheesy, but such a great analogy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:22): LOL
Nate (2013-11-14 15:23): hmm, I just got a flash on a pm that I sent myself 5 minutes ago
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:29): You can usually sense when someone is ready to be unplugged
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:30): My friend from college who I saw the other weekend, still living in Indiana
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:31): He was ready, so I left him my copy of The Rational Male, and now he's absorbing game material at an unhealthy rate and is planning to move to NYC or somewhere else urban
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:32): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:32): thats great
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:33): is the book any diff than all his blog posts?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:33): Not really, it's more just a nice compendium
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 15:33): So you can throw it at a friend and demand that they read it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-14 15:33) (1x <3): yes, i may throw Married Man Sex Life: Primer at my one buddy
Phillatio (2013-11-14 16:08): anyone want to day game
Phillatio (2013-11-14 16:09): after work today

Xander Xone (2013-11-14 16:10): Alright, let's crowdsource my avenue of attack for D-na
Mark (2013-11-14 16:10) (3x <3): just like, be yourself bro
Nate (2013-11-14 16:14): Just think, what would Conan do
Phillatio (2013-11-14 16:15) (1x <3): Conan the barbarian?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 16:16): Yes, my alter ego
Nate (2013-11-14 16:17) (1x <3): Just think "What would contro say"
Phillatio (2013-11-14 16:17) (3x <3): and then do the opposite
Nate (2013-11-14 16:21): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMiksEenaM
Nate (2013-11-14 16:21): Just do exactly this
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 16:26): Alright, time to rope her into the Xander Zone.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 16:31): Where are u guys gonna game?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 16:31): I'll prob be in grand central for 30 min before heading to my date
Nate (2013-11-14 16:31): I have to go home and change before my date, so no time
Mark (2013-11-14 17:09): i usually dont like short haired girls, but this one i could make an exception for
Mark (2013-11-14 17:09): http://ak1.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/360x0/1080x720/0/5964159610902288745.jpeg
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:09): errrrrrrr
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:10): I mean I could see myself fucking her face 
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:10): but only in a creepy priest sort of way
Mark (2013-11-14 17:10): you mean with her dressed up as an altar boy
Mark (2013-11-14 17:10): or a nun
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:11): exactly
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:16): You guys really do love online game 
Mark (2013-11-14 17:16): about as much as i love heroin
Mark (2013-11-14 17:17): its a love hate kind of thing
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:17): It sure beat night game
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:17): replace heroin with pot
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:17): *beats
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:17): idk I like night game better
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:18): at least you're actually meeting face to face
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:18): and its less work
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:18): @Mark I have some excellent short-haired girls in my matches who I haven't messaged yet
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:18): Meh, online game is so easy
Mark (2013-11-14 17:18) (1x <3): if i didnt have a script doing all the legwork for me, id give it up instantly
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:18): That's why it's so dangerous
Mark (2013-11-14 17:19): its like wading through herds of bush hogs to find those few attractive girls
Nate (2013-11-14 17:19) (1x <3): I would like having easy as a backup
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:20) (2x <3): Most PUAs say that online game should be used to compliment your day/night game, but shouldn't replace it, as your approach-muscle shrivles up and atrophies 
Mark (2013-11-14 17:20): yeah thats what it is Nate, a backup, supplement, etc
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:20) (1x <3): It's a great way of repairing my ego when alternated with day game
Mark (2013-11-14 17:20): haha
Nate (2013-11-14 17:20): @Mark yeah, it's a backup, but I still want it.  
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:20): I feel like $1000 today
Nate (2013-11-14 17:20): and I don't have it
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:21) (3x <3): I fucked that girl senseless
Mark (2013-11-14 17:21): dont talk about your mother like that Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:21): I would never disrespect her by calling her a girl. She's a lady, and I made sweet love to her like one, thankyouverymuch
Mark (2013-11-14 17:22): Nate you should be happy you dont have it
Nate (2013-11-14 17:22): she's a slutty bitch of a whore and you'll disrespect her when you like
Mark (2013-11-14 17:22): its just a buffer
Mark (2013-11-14 17:22): and its hard to kick the habit
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:22): i did it
Nate (2013-11-14 17:23): @Mark it would be nice to have backup for times like recently where I've been getting a flake-fest
Nate (2013-11-14 17:23): Also I hate cold
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:23) (2x <3): Night game is the most fun - u get to say all sorts of crazy shit, slap girls' asses, instant makeouts, be self-entertaining.  And u get to drink your face off. 
Day game is awesome for a deeper, quicker connection, see the "real" them.
Online is great practice it seems for text game and easy dates/lays 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:24): I mean, even though that skinny girl is completely nuts, she's still a sweetheart and I enjoy seeing her
Nate (2013-11-14 17:24): Also I need the texting practice, and without a decent online profile I have to burn real numbers to get the practice
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:24): I've met some cool chicks through Tinder
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:25) (2x <3): Or you could just pull a Dimitri the Lover and grab her ass in the middle of the street
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:27): The best pua's will be at least moderately good w/ each form of game, and excel w/ at least one
Mark (2013-11-14 17:27) (1x <3): theres always something off about the girls i meet online
Mark (2013-11-14 17:27) (1x <3): but that just gets me harder
Mark (2013-11-14 17:27) (1x <3): perfect is boring
Nate (2013-11-14 17:29): I
Nate (2013-11-14 17:29): I'm ready for easy mode
Mark (2013-11-14 17:29) (1x <3): maybe ill help you Nate
Mark (2013-11-14 17:30) (2x <3): so you can stop daygaming all the women in ny
Mark (2013-11-14 17:30): and leave some for us
Nate (2013-11-14 17:30): Well I never said I would stop daygaming...
Nate (2013-11-14 17:30): But I wouldn't mind a reliable steady stream of sex from crazy women
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:33): wow
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:33): have you guys seen this 
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:33): http://www.carrotdating.com/
Phillatio (2013-11-14 17:33): that's unbelievably awful
Mark (2013-11-14 17:34): that sets the perfect vibe for a relationship
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:34): I wonder who the hell is calling me right now. Anyone recognize the number 201-344-0690?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:34): And how does it get routed through Viber?
Nate (2013-11-14 17:34): haha, it's basically prostitution with no guaranteed sex
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:35): You mean, buying a dinner and hoping a girl puts out isn't already an unspoken transaction? That's news to me!
Nate (2013-11-14 17:35) (3x <3): I should put up an offer of dollar pizza
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:36): Pro tip: the best dollar slice is on 39th & 6th
Nate (2013-11-14 17:36) (1x <3): the best dollar slice is the one we bring back to my apartment
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:37): It's called joey's pepperoni or something, superb 
Nate (2013-11-14 17:37) (1x <3): even better for carrotdating, post "1 condom"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-14 17:38): Anywho, I'm leaving in 10 min for some game time 
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:38) (2x <3): Sandeep, of course he would swipe that girl.
Nate (2013-11-14 17:40) (3x <3): Sandeep, finding the bottom of the barrel, and then looking under it
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:41): It's a skill, for sure
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:41): Like fishing for catfish
Nate (2013-11-14 17:42): I almost want to send him Kitty, but I think she's suffered enough
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:43): I want him to swipe right 2000 times on Tinder, then hand me his phone a week later and let me set up some dates for him
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:43): For $$$, obviously
Nate (2013-11-14 17:44): hehe
Nate (2013-11-14 17:44): Once I get decent photos I'm gonna do something like that
Nate (2013-11-14 17:44) (1x <3): except I'll get the dates myself
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:45): Can anyone see this?
Xander Xone (2013-11-14 17:45): https://www.facebook.com/events/1380806158810771/?ref=2&ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming
Nate (2013-11-14 17:45): what about it?

Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:35): So check this out...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:36): Was on a 2nd date last night w/ this chick Sophie
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 10:36): we've been waiting OP
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:36): Haven't fucked her yet
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:37): But she's been over to my place, i've gotten pretty close...rubbed her vag (over her pants) when she gave me LMR
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:37): She's a total conservative christian crazy, last night she was telling me why she was in NYC, she thinks that she's supposed to be here cuz God has some purpose for her here
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:38): Anyway
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:38): We're at a bar and decide to hit up Catch in MPD

Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:39): I go in to make out
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:39): She turns away, and says that she thinks we should slow down, she doesn't want us to be those short flings where you fuck and then no contact
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 10:39): ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 10:39): she has previously chased the allure of the noncommittal bad boy lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:41): She said she felt like i was playing her cuz we first met 2 months ago, and I went about a month w/o contacting her
Nate (2013-11-15 10:41): Tell her god sent her here so you could give her a religious experience
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:41): So after that I was thinking "okay sionara crazy"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:42): We go to DL, I get her drunk and make out w/ her anyways
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:42): But she says No, we can't do that!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:42): "Let's go home
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:42): "
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:43): I decide to stay and get her in a cab.  As she gets in she asks "r u sure you don't want to come?" 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:43): "Are you gonna come over to my place" I ask, she says "sorry".  "ok bye!"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:44): I go back downstairs and make 3 approaches, the last of which was good...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:44): But turns out she's a promoter 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:44): Ick
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:45): We leave and get some halal food together and go our separate ways...this is around 4am 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:45): So I'm feeling wrecked 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:45): The End
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:45): (worst story ever)
Nate (2013-11-15 10:47): My date was last night was with a model. She was vacuous and boring, and all my conversation skills leaked out of my brain and spilled on the floor
Nate (2013-11-15 10:48): Date lasted and hour total

Phillatio (2013-11-15 10:48): well I had a great night
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 10:48) (2x <3): Fuck you Phil

Xander Xone (2013-11-15 10:58): @Phil I think I'm back to giving you a run for your money
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 10:58): In terms of the low balance on the bank account
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 10:59): No pun intended

Nate (2013-11-15 11:03): yeah I've been going home at night and drinking, it kills me ability to be productive
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:04) (1x <3): @Phillatio Available Balance: *  $13.67
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:04) (1x <3): And turns you Irish apparently
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:05): That's enough for a huge chipotle burrito bowl w/ guac & chips, i'd say you're doing pretty good
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:06): I don't know when my next paycheck is coming, because my company is behind on our work
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:06): I should probably be more worried about it than I am
Nate (2013-11-15 11:07): you should probably start applying to jobs with a more reliable paychecj
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:08): Yeah. I'm going to see if I can grab any newbs from tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:08): I need to get my side hustle going
Nate (2013-11-15 11:09): write a texting ebook and sell it
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:09): Hmm, okay
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:10) (1x <3): Yeah that'll get you about $50
Nate (2013-11-15 11:10): and after the initial work most of it is just marketing and collecting money
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:10): I wonder why Chateau Heartiste has never released a book of any kind
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:11): They seem to be the most grammatically inclined
Phillatio (2013-11-15 11:14): my thighs hurt so fucking much

Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:27): ...
Nate (2013-11-15 11:33): Number closed a woman who owns a fancy restaurant in flatiron.  Asked her out for the weekend and she didn't reply till I sent a snarky text today.  Says her parents are here for the weekend so can't go out then.  Adding her to my slow play list.
Nate (2013-11-15 11:34): Gonna keep trying tho cause she's rich
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:37): Do u know which restaurant?
Nate (2013-11-15 11:40): http://www.yelp.com/biz/millesime-new-york
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:49): Fancy
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 11:49): Restaurateurs are usually insanely busy
Nate (2013-11-15 11:51): Yeah, I'm sure she's no exception
Nate (2013-11-15 11:53): Not entirely sure how I should play it.
Nate (2013-11-15 11:53): She just said she can't do this weekend.
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:53) (1x <3): Play it like any other girl
Nate (2013-11-15 11:53): If I immediately suggest some time next week I run the danger of looking needy, but she's really busy so I don't wanna be spam texting her
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:54): Then don't spam text her
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:55) (1x <3): Send her infrequent messages
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:56) (1x <3): You want to give the impression that "I still remember that you're alive and I'm interested, but we're both busy people, so let's hang out when we can"
Nate (2013-11-15 11:57): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/dcdee63030440131b8cc12313b12cc51
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:57): Urgh...
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:57): Your second text makes me cringe
Nate (2013-11-15 11:57): yeah
Nate (2013-11-15 11:58): it was referencing something she said earlier where she said my text was sweet
Nate (2013-11-15 11:58): which it wasn't really supposed to be so I wasn't sure she wasn't being sarcastic
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:58): It just seems very apologetic
Nate (2013-11-15 11:59): yeah it was shitty
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 11:59): And you're qualifying yourself to her "Guess I'll have to try harder"
Nate (2013-11-15 12:01): Yeah this is what I meant about my texting needing a lot of help
Nate (2013-11-15 12:02): I think about what I want to get out of it, not what I want to frame
Nate (2013-11-15 12:02): @Xander what would you say next and when?
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 12:07): I think that you're letting your inner game issues show through text
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 12:08): In person, you can generally get away with it because you have the outer game down, the routines set on automatic, so you can rely on that bravado
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 12:09): But you're second-guessing yourself here, since texting gives you too much time to analyze, and your doubts and insecurities affect your messages
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 12:11) (3x <3): You should be insanely self-confident, to the point of delusion. This bitch just lucked out; she has a chance with a stud who has balls of steel along with wit. She should be honored
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 12:15): Outstanding comment of the morning goes to Xander Xone
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 12:15): http://replygif.net/i/960.gif
Jimmyayo (2013-11-15 12:17) (1x <3): I don't have much to add, except this.  
If you feel like your text game needs work, try minimal text game.  Short, infrequent messages. 
Nate (2013-11-15 12:23): I think it's not really my text game as much as it is my frame and inner game (ala Xander)
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:27) (3x <3): Left foot declared by doctor as broken
Nate (2013-11-15 12:28) (2x <3): Confirming what you already knew
Nate (2013-11-15 12:34) (3x <3): Does that mean next time we see you we'll be calling you pegleg?
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:35): Haha
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:36): I'm not wearing the cast fuck that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:36): what are u goign to do then Marcus
Nate (2013-11-15 12:36): Ahh a masochist.  You'd prefer to be in pain the rest of your life

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:38): lol Marcus it will suck man

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:38) (2x <3): but u will be grateful when u  heal and can live a normal life
Phillatio (2013-11-15 12:38): wait

Nate (2013-11-15 12:39): @Phil its been broken for months
Phillatio (2013-11-15 12:39) (3x <3): that's hardcore bro
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:40): The pain sucks equally
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:41): Fall/Winter on Crutches is no joke man
Nate (2013-11-15 12:41): better than summer on crutches
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:42): havent done summer
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:42): winter though, it's colder, u may have to slog thru the snow

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-15 12:43): if u live on a 5th floor walk-up, then I recommend committing seppuku and just saving urself from the misery

Marcus (2013-11-15 12:49): Yeah. I knew it was going to happened sooner or later.. The cast part that is
Nate (2013-11-15 12:49): I'm not a big fan of Artichoke.  It's too much like eating a lard pizza
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:49): The pizza was heavy
Marcus (2013-11-15 12:50): Not eating that again
Phillatio (2013-11-15 12:51): I brought the left overs to work today
Phillatio (2013-11-15 12:52) (1x <3): if artichoke is lard, lard is delicious 
Mark (2013-11-15 12:52): love artichoke
Mark (2013-11-15 12:53) (1x <3): especially the hot cum topping
Xander Xone (2013-11-15 13:20) (2x <3): You're all whining like little schoolgirls
Mark (2013-11-15 13:29): the lard helps lubricate my colon for effortless evacuation

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 18:19): Lol @ bring da movies
D-money (2013-11-17 18:22): i have a question
Marcus (2013-11-17 18:22): Go on
D-money (2013-11-17 18:23): so i met this girl on vacation here. she goes back to her country, and we talk online a lot for like a month
D-money (2013-11-17 18:24): flirty/ sexual convos/ playful
D-money (2013-11-17 18:24): and then she visits for a weekend and it goes really well i think
D-money (2013-11-17 18:24): and now the convos it seems like she isnt as flirty/ sexual anymore
D-money (2013-11-17 18:24): is it cus shes already claimed her prize and not that interested anymore? or she doesnt' want our relatinoship to be based solely on that?
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:24): Did you guys have sex
D-money (2013-11-17 18:24): yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:25): Why are you talking like a girl?
D-money (2013-11-17 18:25): lol
D-money (2013-11-17 18:25): i dont know how else to think, i'm programmed this way
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:26): "Claimed her prize" sounds like something that a chick would say when she's wondering if she has been pumped and dumped
D-money (2013-11-17 18:26): i mean like.. the intrigue is gone
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:27): Why? Have you already revealed everything about yourself?
D-money (2013-11-17 18:27): no
D-money (2013-11-17 18:28): but i definitely became somewhat attached
Nate (2013-11-17 18:28): Did you suck in bed?
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:28) (3x <3): did she suck in bed? ;)
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:28) (1x <3): You need to unlearn your blue pill traits, tong
D-money (2013-11-17 18:29): lol i need to read on what that is
D-money (2013-11-17 18:30): no she was really good and i was really good
D-money (2013-11-17 18:30): i go for a long time and people are always surprised
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 18:30): This is a long distance relationship. You need to emotionally distance yourself too
D-money (2013-11-17 18:31): word
D-money (2013-11-17 18:32): so.. any explanations for the change in our convos?
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:33): yes
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:33): you're not together
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:33): just keep it going and match her investment level
D-money (2013-11-17 18:37): sounds like pretty sound advice
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:42): go here
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:42): http://therationalmale.com/the-best-of-rational-male-year-one/
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:42) (1x <3): and read all of the iron rules
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:42): the other stuff is good too but iron rules is a good place to start
D-money (2013-11-17 18:45): kk
D-money (2013-11-17 18:49): she says things like " you can do better".. like make more of an effort in our conversation. thats operating in her frame huh
Nate (2013-11-17 18:50): duh
Marcus (2013-11-17 18:50): Post some pucs

Nate (2013-11-17 18:54): @Dmoney if you actually cater to her dumb you can do better messages, then she's probably losing respect for you
D-money (2013-11-17 18:54): how to win back?
Marcus (2013-11-17 18:54): Text pics dude
Marcus (2013-11-17 18:54): Screenshots

Nate (2013-11-17 18:55): also nudes
Phillatio (2013-11-17 18:55) (3x <3): "ight bitch, hit me up when you wanna suck some dick"
D-money (2013-11-17 18:56): lol
D-money (2013-11-17 18:56): theyre not specific texts
Nate (2013-11-17 18:56): well no if she said "you need to do better" it was in reaction to specific texts
D-money (2013-11-17 18:58): i think it was cus i was kind of slow at responding
D-money (2013-11-17 18:58): not sure exactly wht she ment
D-money (2013-11-17 18:58): and wasnt being more witty maybe
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 19:18): Just thought of a ping text that I used:
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 19:18) (2x <3): "I just saw the world's largest rat. It was like a sumo wrestler"
Phillatio (2013-11-17 20:31): just got this gem on FB 
Phillatio (2013-11-17 20:31): "hello jessica. i want us 2 kno eachother vry wel. if u luk my pics u wil c dat my face luk familia. can we chat 4 gud relationship. pls"
Phillatio (2013-11-17 20:31): on my fake facebook profile
D-money (2013-11-17 22:44): where can i read about redpill / blue pill?
D-money (2013-11-17 22:45): and why do you have a fake fb profile?
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 22:45): r/theredpill
D-money (2013-11-17 22:47): what should i read on this page?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 22:47) (1x <3): D-money i think Phil's link to the rationalmale archive is sufficient
D-money (2013-11-17 22:47): i read those iron man articles, they were pretty good
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 22:48): that's a pretty well-written and covers a lot of topics
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 22:50): Everything on the sidebar in theredpill
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 22:50): That's why it's on the sidebar
D-money (2013-11-17 22:51) (1x <3): lol k
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 22:55): @Nate, a bit delayed but here is that hip-hop/dubstep genre playset i put together

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 22:55): https://soundcloud.com/propdres/propdres-the-prince-of-pu-rple
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 22:55): well, fuck, i'll email it to ya
D-money (2013-11-17 23:04) (1x <3): @xander, earlier you said i need to erase my blue pill kind of thinking. is it because i'm too idealistic?
Xander Xone (2013-11-17 23:05): Yes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 23:05) (1x <3): that line of thinking is usually a result of social conditioning
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:06): Good cheap date spots for a weeknight. From 23 to 10 or so. Go
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:07): Flatiron room expensive?
Phillatio (2013-11-17 23:07) (1x <3): semi expensive
Phillatio (2013-11-17 23:07) (1x <3): its not awful
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:09): Per drink?
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:09): $
Nate (2013-11-17 23:16) (1x <3): Solas is good during the week
Nate (2013-11-17 23:16): $5 drinks
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:17): Only front bar open though no?
Nate (2013-11-17 23:17): yeah
Nate (2013-11-17 23:17): but it's usually pretty dead, so there's plenty of space
Nate (2013-11-17 23:19): I like going to Whiskey Rebel, but only until Wednesday
Nate (2013-11-17 23:19): Lallisse is never super crowded near me, but a bit pricier
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:20): What's best seating wise?
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:20): Want couch seat preferably
Marcus (2013-11-17 23:20): http://www.drinkowl.com/us/new-york/drink-specials
Nate (2013-11-17 23:21): When it's not crowded Whiskey Rebel has the best seats.  The seats in the back of Solas are usually available
Nate (2013-11-17 23:21): Lallisse is a bit bright, but the seats are covered in pillows
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 23:21) (2x <3): http://i.imgur.com/d1CQMhX.gif

TiMex (2013-11-17 23:22): Good stuff
Nate (2013-11-17 23:22): I'd love to know of other good places
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:23): ok, looks like flatiron or whiskey rebel for now
Nate (2013-11-17 23:23): what day?
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:23): wed probably
Marcus (2013-11-17 23:23): $3 mixed drinks at down the hatch on thursday
Nate (2013-11-17 23:25): whiskey rebel does occasionally get crowded (covering my ass if it is).  Lallise is a block away tho.
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:25): haha
TiMex (2013-11-17 23:25): ok
D-money (2013-11-17 23:35): @xander/pippy so i know i've been taking the blue pill now.. optimistic, idealistic, but what's the redpill, more cynical/ girls are sluts, opportunists. etc?
Nate (2013-11-17 23:36): girls are sluts is worse than the blue pill
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 23:36): It's a more cause/effect way at looking at inter-gender relations
Nate (2013-11-17 23:37) (1x <3): it's not optimistic vs cynical.  It's not putting women ahead of yourself in priority.
Nate (2013-11-17 23:37) (1x <3): and not putting them on pedistals just because they have tits
D-money (2013-11-17 23:38): pippy what do you mean cause/effect way
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-17 23:40) (2x <3): It removes that romanticized Disney-esque frame to relationships and attraction
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 00:10): Fellas, can you upvote that ^^^ if u got a quick sec

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 09:20): good for him
Phillatio (2013-11-18 09:43) (1x <3): Gross
Nate (2013-11-18 09:54): She has nice lips.  I'm more disappointed that he chickened out for the 10th time
Phillatio (2013-11-18 09:58) (1x <3): Nicole: 
"I got a bit of a dilemma.. I got back with my ex again.. so we can't kiss I think 😢 but as friends is no problem hihi you still can sleep in my bed 😃"
Phillatio (2013-11-18 09:58) (1x <3): Fantastic
Nate (2013-11-18 09:59): hahaha you can still sleep in my bed.  I've never heard bullshit more.  Like she wouldn't fuck you then
Phillatio (2013-11-18 09:59) (1x <3): Lol
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:00) (2x <3): I'm pretty sure I'll just hook up with one of her hotter friends
Nate (2013-11-18 10:00): Why not do both...
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:00) (1x <3): I was getting to that
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:01) (2x <3): And then when she's nice and jealous boom goes the dynamite
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:03) (1x <3): What a fucking polarizing message.
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:04) (1x <3): "Can't kiss I think" and y
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:04) (1x <3): Ou can still sleep in my bed
Nate (2013-11-18 10:04) (1x <3): She's just playing girl games to make you jealous
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:04) (1x <3): Ugh bad timing
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:05) (1x <3): Yea probs good thing I mostly don't care
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:05): Who pulled that?
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:06): I always end up pleasuring the girls without reciprocation. Anyone have any advice on how to get them to be a team player?
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:07): That little gem extracted from the Jersey groupme
Nate (2013-11-18 10:07): @Xander tell them what to do
Nate (2013-11-18 10:07): oh you're not asking :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:07): Are you fucking kidding me?
Nate (2013-11-18 10:07): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:08): I don't even care about the girl's pleasure. I see to my own
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:08) (1x <3): I care to a point
Nate (2013-11-18 10:08): Tell him "Climb up on her head and stick your stick in her mouth.  Make sure she gags"
Nate (2013-11-18 10:08): I like the taste of pussy...
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:09) (1x <3): You're all sissy boys
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:12) (1x <3): Lol
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:12) (1x <3): Why is it so fucking hot today
Nate (2013-11-18 10:12): I'm more of a sassy boy
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:12) (1x <3): I'm more of a boy
Nate (2013-11-18 10:12): @phil why isn't it this fucking hot every other day
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:12) (1x <3): I hate it. I want to wear my big coat
Nate (2013-11-18 10:13): I hate cold, I want global warming
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:13) (1x <3): Train time

Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:18): Kind of a hipster but whatevs
Nate (2013-11-18 10:29) (1x <3): Yeah I'd bang.
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:32) (1x <3): Oh hell yea
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:37): As soon as a girl likes me back, my attraction level for her immediately starts dropping 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:37): That hipster girl I liked pretty hard
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:38): She went back to Vancouver...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:38): But now is talking about coming to visit over a long wknd
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:38): And I'm just...ehhhhhhhh
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:38) (1x <3): I don't want to turn into Hot Tongs w/ his Frenchie  =)
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:38) (1x <3): I'm pretty sure you're all good
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:39) (1x <3): and you should probably see her 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:42): You think?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:43) (1x <3): hell yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:43) (1x <3): she's damn cute
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:43): O
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:44): Yeah, you're starting to over-analyze this shit as much as a girl would
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:44): Haha I was expecting a deeper reason than just the physical traits
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:44): I think we're all in danger of reverting back to pussified form
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:44): Lol chill out brah it's not like that at all
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:45) (1x <3): Oh, I'm chill. I'm ICE cold
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:45) (1x <3): black as the blackest night
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:45) (1x <3): and cold as the darkest winter
Nate (2013-11-18 10:45) (1x <3): @jimmy the only reason you'd stay with a girl longer than random sex is if there is more than physical traits
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:46) (1x <3): What's "random sex"? Like when she trips and lands on your cock?
Nate (2013-11-18 10:46): The reason we ditch girls so frequently is once the blood is back to our brains we realize they are boring
Nate (2013-11-18 10:46): @Xander yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:46): This probably won't make sense, but if I invited her over for the wknd and she said ok, then I'd be cool w/ her visiting.  But her suggesting it first w/o me inviting her...it kinda kills the attraction a bit 
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:47): Why? Unless she's being overly clingy, it doesn't seem to matter
Nate (2013-11-18 10:47) (2x <3): @Xander because jimmy is mental
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:48) (1x <3): that's my guess ^
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:48) (1x <3): dude who cares
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:48) (2x <3): Jimmy, it's okay to have a girl like you
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:48) (1x <3): NO IT'S FUCKING NOT
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:48) (1x <3): Isn't that the fucking point of this?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:48): jk
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:49): Yeah I know
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:49) (2x <3): I don't know what the point is anymore
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:49) (1x <3): I lost sight of it long ago
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:49): The point is whatever you want it to be, just as long as you're not coming from a place from scarcity
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:49): *of scarcity
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:50): Maybe the point of this journey for you, is to figure out what the point should be for you
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 10:50) (1x <3): If you enjoy her company, then spend some time with her. It's not like you're getting married
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:50): Flying across the country to see someone you only had 1 day/night with, seems like a big investment 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:51) (2x <3): that's why she's probably not seirous
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:51) (1x <3): but its no investment for you
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:51) (1x <3): so who cares
Nate (2013-11-18 10:52) (1x <3): @jimmy did it occur to you she wants to come back to new york, and you are a cheap place to stay?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:53): Lol 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 10:53): Not really
Nate (2013-11-18 10:54) (2x <3): I also got into this for the bros
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:55) (1x <3): I thought I was the only one ^
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 10:58): Jimmy's feeling is understandable tho
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 10:58): perhaps there is something in how she said it or broached the subject of visiting that deflated the air out of your balloon for ya
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:58) (1x <3): not to that extreme 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 10:59) (1x <3): it would only lower my investment level slightly but not pull me out of the game altogether
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 10:59): do you feel she is leeching off ya a bit Jimmy? U mentioned one time how u get a feeling some girls try to do that, as it pertains to ur involvement in the club scene
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 11:00): lol, girls trying to leech off of you in the club scene? Whodathunkit?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 11:00): lol, I dont think Jimmy is being a homo for feeling this way. maybe he didnt convey the true source of his sudden change of heart
Nate (2013-11-18 11:01) (2x <3): Nothing kills my attraction faster than a girl who I think is trying to get something out of me other than my dick or my attention
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 11:03): Heh heh heh
Nate (2013-11-18 11:04): http://art.ngfiles.com/images/106/liquify_beavis.gif
Nate (2013-11-18 11:05): Nothing better than finding an image of beavis on bibleforums.org
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:11) (2x <3): I think my IQ lowered by going to that website
Marcus (2013-11-18 11:11): U liked ur own comment
Marcus (2013-11-18 11:11): It has been lowered
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:12) (3x <3): just my own personal pat on the back
Marcus (2013-11-18 11:12): Lmao
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:26): So how was yalls weekends?  Any stories of pussy/anus destruction
Nate (2013-11-18 11:26): I turned down sex with an old fuckbuddy yesterday because when I saw her she gained weight and I lost interest.
Nate (2013-11-18 11:27) (3x <3): We had a triple feature movie night at my place on Saturday
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:28) (2x <3): I liked judge dredd the best
Nate (2013-11-18 11:29) (3x <3): I dunno, I also like Gangster Squad a lot.  Not sure I can decide

Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:39) (2x <3): I'm slightly less excited now
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:40) (3x <3): but I'm still gonna have an awesome time
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:40) (1x <3): worst case scenario I'll bang Marcelle 
Nate (2013-11-18 11:42) (3x <3): Frankly going to europe shouldn't be about having sex anyway, it's about going to europe
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:43) (1x <3): fair point
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:43) (1x <3): Haha srsly man, you'll have an excellent time whether u fuck chicks or not
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:43): Paris and Amsterdam right?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:43) (1x <3): that's a bingo 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:44): and wherever nicole lives Enschede or something
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:44): I'll  have a car so I can basically go anywhere 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:44): I might take a trip through germany 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:45): Make sure u get to ride a bike around Amsterdam for at least 1 day, best way to get around town
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:45): Vondelpark is a great place to run daygame, it's kinda like their central park
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:46): okay awesome
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:47): Damn I'm really jealous right now
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:48): you should be lol 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:48): Do you have a travel guide book for Amsterdam? 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:48): nope
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:48): Wanna borrow mine?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:48): um hell yeah

Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:49): O
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:49): The Ann Frank house is fucking surreal dude
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 11:49) (1x <3): You walk through the house and see where they kept her hidden, if ur into that kinda sobering history shit
Nate (2013-11-18 11:51): okay, dre's playlist ended and I'm listening to hardcore now.  I have no idea where it's coming from...
Nate (2013-11-18 11:51): it's pretty awesome tho
Phillatio (2013-11-18 11:51): I am indeed 
Nate (2013-11-18 11:51): @phil knowledged!
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:22): "Maybe I have a nice friend for you 
Nina
You are her type hihi"
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:22): nicole again
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:22): she's nuts
Nate (2013-11-18 12:22): especially because she said she wants you to sleep in her bed
Nate (2013-11-18 12:23): she's rationalizing for when she sleeps with you and cheats
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:23): yeah 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:23): I suppose
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:23): its hard to tell with europeans
Nate (2013-11-18 12:23): well maybe
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:24): I asked her if she was my type
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 12:34): Classic Nicole
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:37): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/08f98c4032a60131420a22000aef140c
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:37): well there's Nina
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:37): I guess I would bang her
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:38): not as pretty as Nicole 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:43): WYB?
Nate (2013-11-18 12:44): does she have huge hands or is her waist photshopped to be thinner?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:47): I think she has huge hands
Nate (2013-11-18 12:47): well I'm a sucker for blondes, and she does have a nice face
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:49): its alright
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:49): I would bang
Nate (2013-11-18 12:50): she's definitely tall

Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:50): she is
Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:51): I think she's taller than nicole and nicole is like 5'10"

Phillatio (2013-11-18 12:58): I'll probably hit on her and all her friends
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 13:00): Best case scenario for that would be to have a party w/ her and a bunch of her friends at a bar 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 13:00): Like a "Vilkommen to Amsterdam Phil!" party 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:01): true dat

Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:45): blue pill stuff has a way of doing that to a man
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:45): there's work to be done boys
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:48): I definitely didn't go into work today
Nate (2013-11-18 13:49): What were you doing last night?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:49): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:50) (1x <3): watching there will be blood
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:51): It's not that I stayed up late. I actually went to sleep pretty early
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:51): Think I'm just emotionally decompressing
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:51) (2x <3): "a woman for you is someone who has to depend on a man??
who can't decide anything or have anything and has to ask for permission??
I think the arabs have got something going for them

I'm messing with you doll face"
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:53): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 13:53): patronizing the shit out of her
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:54): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:58): H/T @heartiste Loki is uglier than Thor, but chick nerdettes love Loki more. Bad boy charm >> male looks.
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 13:58): https://t.co/fmz31VgHqs
Nate (2013-11-18 14:01) (1x <3): Also doesn't hurt that Loki has an actual personality and Thor has none
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:06) (1x <3): seriously GOL posting pictures of your tests
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:09): H/T ‏@neilstrauss Social proof as not just a psychological phenomenon, but a visual one: People seem more attractive in groups:
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:09): ow.ly/qUrZF
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:10): This past week has been one giant reminder of red pill truths
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:11): that link is broken
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:11): oh nvm
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:11): its just slow
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:12): Sweet, innocent seeming girl shamelessly cheats on her boyfriend with me while he's out of town, ball-busting feministy girl caves and gobbles my cock due to my strong frame control, and the girl who I was emotionally over-invested in flakes and disappears from the face of the earth
TiMex (2013-11-18 14:14): The date from yesterday?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:14): lol seems pretty evident when you present it like that
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:14): @TiMex Yes
Nate (2013-11-18 14:20) (1x <3): Xander just went back and read me ripping apart Sandeep's world last night
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:21) (1x <3): I'm a fan
Nate (2013-11-18 14:21): Boy needs tough love, no mothering that bitch
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:23): I think I'm content to let the world burn at this point
Nate (2013-11-18 14:23): I prefer to light the match
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:24): I prefer to pour the gasoline 
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:27): Just sent my final message
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:27): Were you "getting back" at me yesterday? I'm tired of these games, so I'm done. Later
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:28): Uuuuuugh, of course she messages me back within 10 seconds

Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:35): Just, wow.
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:36): I don't even know what I would respond
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:36): this is how you should resond 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:36) (1x <3): don't 
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:37): you said you were done and you are
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:37): it doesn't change anything
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:37): Hmm... I need to go ponder this
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:38) (1x <3): Perhaps my mind will be clearer after 150 squats
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:38): lmao
Nate (2013-11-18 14:39): @phil I told him this exact thing could happen, that her phone might not have been available
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:42): yah well
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:42): I stand by what I said
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:42): She just apologized again, too
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:43): eh
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:43): see how you feel about it tomorrow
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:44): "Again in sorry I just was being selfish and laying in bed feeling sorry for myself. Not trying to be spiteful sorry :/"
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:46) (1x <3): I think I'll go with @dimitrithelover 's tweet today: RELATIONSHIP TIP: Only accept her apologies IN WRITING! Save them in 
SCRAPBOOK titled "I WAS WRONG" to show her she's LUCKY you haven't left
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 14:49) (2x <3): God, that fucking crying baby is outside again! Where's my shotgun!?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 14:53) (1x <3): "PHIL:
everything you make sounds awesome
and you say it so humbly

NICOLE:
Hahah what's humbly again

PHIL:

humbly is the space between your belly button and your pubic hair

NICOLE:

Ok

PHIL:

NICOLE:

Nate (2013-11-18 15:10): Should have stayed longer in set but I needed to get back to the office
Phillatio (2013-11-18 15:32): cutish
Nate (2013-11-18 15:34): she was hotter in person

Xander Xone (2013-11-18 16:16) (1x <3): Wartortle is evolving!
Mark (2013-11-18 16:17) (1x <3): And Nate, i number closed a tall thin russian in usq named Anastasia who looks remarkably similar to the girl you posted
Mark (2013-11-18 16:17): Not sure how common that name is in russia
Nate (2013-11-18 16:17): pretty common
Nate (2013-11-18 16:23): Although it's a small world, I would not be surprised if it happened

Nate (2013-11-18 17:00): @Xander why?
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 17:00): Since I don't even want to go back to school. It's like I'm still trying to prove something to myself
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 17:00): But it's a self from when I was in college
Phillatio (2013-11-18 17:01): I used to think about that too
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 17:01): It's more of an ego thing. I wanted to prove to people that I was really smart
Phillatio (2013-11-18 17:01): now I realize education is only useful to a point
Phillatio (2013-11-18 17:01): Dr. Xander

Nate (2013-11-18 17:14): "Yeah you gave you're number out so many times yesterday, it is hard to keep track" - is this bad?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 17:14): poosie paradise?
Phillatio (2013-11-18 17:14) (1x <3): "I had to blow a guy in the bathroom to get this number"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-18 17:15) (2x <3): It's playful which is good, but you're framing her to be the one of higher value
Nate (2013-11-18 17:15): that's what I thought
Nate (2013-11-18 17:16): not sure best way to reply to this

Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:09): lol, sounds like a beeeeeyotch
Nate (2013-11-18 23:09): she was definitely a pain in the ass
Nate (2013-11-18 23:10): Not sure what motivated her to contact me.  I'm surprised I didn't delete her number
Nate (2013-11-18 23:10) (1x <3): @Xander what do you think of my exchange?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:11): nice work Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:11): way to push the envelope there, in terms of length and the fun aspect of it all
Nate (2013-11-18 23:12): Thanks.  I had nothing at all to lose so I just went for it
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:13): It's pretty awesome
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:13): Such a weak attempt on her part to reframe you as being the flaky person
Nate (2013-11-18 23:13): Yeah I just ignored that
Nate (2013-11-18 23:14): Did I make any mistakes?
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:14): Nope

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:17) (1x <3): I think you meant "I'm gr8. u?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:18): Hahaha
Nate (2013-11-18 23:18) (1x <3): @pippy it took me long enough to interpret her crappy how are you text, I returned the favor.  That was intentional
Nate (2013-11-18 23:19): I wanted it to look like I took no effort at all in returning it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:20): http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/happy-i-see-what-you-did-there-%28clean%29-l.png

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:21): lol slight troll but now that Nate mentioned it, it makes sense what he did
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:21): Nah, the more mistakes the better
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:21) (2x <3): Looks like you really don't give a shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:21) (1x <3): Which is good
Nate (2013-11-18 23:22): I learned that from Xander
Nate (2013-11-18 23:23): I have another text question, but it can wait till tomorrow
Nate (2013-11-18 23:23): I decided to stop asking specific "what do I say questions" and start asking "what should I be thinking about here when responding" questions
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:23): No it can't

Nate (2013-11-18 23:25): I don't like where this convo is going
Nate (2013-11-18 23:26): I need to take it in a more fun direction, but I'm not sure what frame I should be taking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:26): hm yeah.  Hard to explain but when you threw that "flu shot" line out there, it forced it into a place u dont wanna go
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-18 23:26): still recoverable but i yield to Darth Vader on the text
Nate (2013-11-18 23:26): yeah, hence me wanting to change directions
Nate (2013-11-18 23:27): yeah she's replying even tho she's sick.  I just need to know what frame I should take here
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:27): I dunno man, I'm off the map right now
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:28): I'm testing out some material that is super secret

Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:30): I'm trying to free your mind, Nate.
Nate (2013-11-18 23:30): I'm trying to let my mind free
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:31): Texting is a world of pure thought, pure idea. You can bend anything to your will
Nate (2013-11-18 23:31): I still working on the spoon, but I do think it bent slightly
Nate (2013-11-18 23:32): Tomorrow's gonna suck hardcore tho

Nate (2013-11-18 23:37): Got 5 numbers today, so plenty of practice for tomorrow
Nate (2013-11-18 23:37): Took me 10 minutes to remember who one of them was, she really made an impression
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:37): Maybe I should start selling candy grams or something after work
Nate (2013-11-18 23:38): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:48): Here is my quote of the day for you gentlemen:
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:48): Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal. - Robert A. Heinlein
Nate (2013-11-18 23:49): I love Heinlein
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:54): I love lamp
Nate (2013-11-18 23:55): not a huge fan of php
Nate (2013-11-18 23:55): or mysql
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:56): Like shitty facebook php
Nate (2013-11-18 23:56): if that's the lamp you are referring
Xander Xone (2013-11-18 23:57): I think I ate your chocolate squirrel.
Nate (2013-11-18 23:59): damn, and I was looking forward to moving on that
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:01): Honestly, I think that girls want to be treated like children. They want you to put them to bed with a bedtime story after you've stuffed them full of dick
Nate (2013-11-19 00:01): I'm perfectly fine with that
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:01): Me too. I love reading books aloud
Nate (2013-11-19 00:02): The stuffing dick part isn't half bad either
Nate (2013-11-19 00:02): I used to think "why do I always have to be the one in charge, can't they contribute".  Now I think "I want to dominate them like the little toys they are"
Nate (2013-11-19 00:04): Have to admit, having a gigantic ego talking to girls is so much fun
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:06): Yep
Nate (2013-11-19 00:10): I've only begun at this at the high I get from dominating them is huge.  When I'm actually good at it... Oh yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:12): I've forgotten about the world
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:12): Game has taken over everything
Nate (2013-11-19 00:13): There is only one world.  It's looking at the screen right now.
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:16): When you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:16): cool quote
Nate (2013-11-19 00:20): Xander has ability to remember obscure literary references better than any I know
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:24): Sometimes, it's difficult to accept that this is all there is, the daily struggle of grinding through work, sparring with girls, and trying to steal away a few moments where you can quell the roar of desires and doubts in your brain
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:24): hmmmm
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:24): Krauser?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:25): Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:25) (1x <3): XanderPUA
Nate (2013-11-19 00:25): It's not all there is, but becoming an expert in a skill requires 10,000 hours of time.  That time is better spent all at once.
Nate (2013-11-19 00:26): Not only that, but many other skills get built with it
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:26): I'm not going to find any transcendence through that activity, though
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:27): I'm going to get increasingly disillusioned with women as a whole, if that's even possible, until they become little more than meat popsicles to me
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:27): I'm already approaching that state
Nate (2013-11-19 00:27): Women don't bring meaning.  They satisfy humanity's innate need for company and companionship.  Basic needs must be met.
Nate (2013-11-19 00:27): Well not all women are meat, however many are
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:27) (1x <3): Quite, but perhaps the struggle to get better with women could impart meaning
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:28): I think it did for a little while, but it's not any more
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:28): I'm back to where I started
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:28): Xander u might be going to a new stage
Nate (2013-11-19 00:28): My struggle to get better with women has brought some meaning to me.  It forced me to look at the person I was, the person I want to be, and the places I need to be to get there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:28): this could be good
Nate (2013-11-19 00:29): @Xander you're having a rough time in other areas of your life now, which is the origin of your current dilemmas
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:31): I wonder who the hell just texted me
Nate (2013-11-19 00:31): ask them?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:32): I just heard that big "WHOO-OOO-OOMP" sound, since I turned my volume all the way up
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:32): And would you look at that...
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:35): Nate and Pippy, I'm tagging you guys in
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:38): Me: Let's hang out Wednesday. You'll feel better
Me: We shall watch movies and laugh at the hubris of humanity. I will tell you of my travels on the high seas
Dana: Ha oh yeah? Where's that?
Dana: Okay I'm not sure if I can do weds though my grad apps are due friday
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:39): lol its already been tried but try hitting her with that ellipsis "..."
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:39): you lose nothing
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:39): I did hit her with that before
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:39): lol, shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:39): Unfortunately, the effect was wasted because her phone had been lost
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:40): hmmm
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:40): I mean, WHAT the FUCK is all this shiftiness
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:41): she could be per-emptively flaking
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:42): what's a good text that will push her off the fence....into the Xander Xone
Nate (2013-11-19 00:42): So much time has passed her emotion meter as run low
Nate (2013-11-19 00:42): *has
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:42): I don't know
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:42): She definitely texted up a storm of apology earlier today for flaking on Sunday because of her lost phone
Nate (2013-11-19 00:43): She could just have grad apps due Friday...
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:43): I think she does
Nate (2013-11-19 00:43): The answer isn't always complex
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:43): Since she has been doing grad apps all along
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:43): yeah true that
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:44): That's why it took her two weeks for our day 1 to happen after we met at 13th step
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:44) (1x <3): +1 Nate for being reasonable lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:44): I'll put my pitchfork back now...
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:44): I don't think she's good at managing her time/emotions
Nate (2013-11-19 00:44) (1x <3): A girl with bad time management skills?  Never!
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:45): I think she wants me to reschedule for the weekend. That's basically what she's saying
Nate (2013-11-19 00:45): Yeah, so do it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:46): so how about this
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:46): give her the option to resched for next week
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:46): but i would get her to commit to that and display some kind of excitement to it, or to make it that she's really looking forward to it
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:46): "Since you're dying for a dose of Xander time, we can do ______"
Nate (2013-11-19 00:47) (2x <3): "Your grad apps may hold you now, but this <saturday,sunday> is mine to plunder."
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:47): Nate's is congruent to the way u were texting earlier Xander
Nate (2013-11-19 00:48): I kept the high seas theme
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:48): lol lovin' it
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:49): Hahaha
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:49): I almost want to right "ye" instead of "you"
Nate (2013-11-19 00:50): do it
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:50) (2x <3): Done and done
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:53): It's so hard for me to be objective and have fun with this...
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:53): Hasn't been a problem for any other person
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:54): It's like this whole thing has been the cancer to my game
Nate (2013-11-19 00:54): Well I have a much easier time with other people as well.  When it becomes important it becomes more difficult
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:55): hey man don't sweat it, there are plenty of Dana's in the sea
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:55): I know it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 00:55) (2x <3): the high seas, that is
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 00:55) (2x <3): YARRRRR

Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): Need to respond to this
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): Could be straight up, like "tasty drinks, good music"
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): Could be arrogant "of course because I chose it"
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): or a combination
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): "tasty drinks, good music, and of course because I chose it"
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): or something else
Nate (2013-11-19 11:02): recommendations?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:05): I'd say either be 1) plain and simple/straightforward, or 2) funny/ham.  I wouldn't play the arrogant card to hard here, it's overkill - your last text was authoritative enough
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 11:05): And Omega Prime emerges from his cave.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 11:06): Nate: "Because I don't want to get you pregnant"
Nate (2013-11-19 11:06): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:07): Don't you know their bartenders?
Nate (2013-11-19 11:07): yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:08): Yeah, so I'd say something like that then - I know their bartenders and they usually hook us up w/ free drinks
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:09): Or whatever
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:39): I think I found a new awesome spot to game

Xander Xone (2013-11-19 11:40): What is that
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:43): It's like a marketplace w/ a bunch of different food/booze stands, live bands, art, shopping
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:43): Lots of cute hipster chicks 
Phillatio (2013-11-19 11:44): sounds like heaven
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 11:44): It's great because it's kinda like a blend between daygame/nightgame
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 11:45): Nice

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:16): so check the sidebar and u can browse them in chronological order
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:24): Just when I thought I was gonna be productive...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:28): productive in a diff
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:38): This YaReally comment strikes home:
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:38): On the flip side a lot of newbie/intermediate PUAs define themselves by 
their newfound superpowers of seduction, so as Tyler says “a PUA is the 
only guy who will be frustrated that a girl HE DOESN’T EVEN LIKE, 
doesn’t like him.” lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:41): yupppppppppppppp!\
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:42): i think i've seen it witnessed in the chat here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:42): a girl you don' tcare about not liiking u is an insult to ur ego
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:42): It's my narcissism. I want to be loved and admired by people, even if I hate them
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:42): yep yep, filed under #IntermediatePUAProbz
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:42): anyways Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:43): this old post by Mark Manson is incredible

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:43): nails each of them
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:44): (ahem), so give it a look, u will most liekly enjoy
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:45): I've essentially fallen back to omega level, with all of this job bullshit
Phillatio (2013-11-19 12:47): fuck Xander 
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:49): I'm going to take my game to the next level: Get the chick to pay for everything on the first date
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:50): "Oh shit, I forgot my wallet"
Phillatio (2013-11-19 12:50): I did that with ellen
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:50): Pull the classic bitchy girl maneuver

P.S. To all the up and comers…I can’t think of a better way to practice text game (which to me seems crucial to get to the prime cuts these days) than to get on Tinder. Seriously. Lots of girls who are on facebook are on it whereas they might not be on match or some of the others. Check it out fo sho.
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:53): Yeah, that's why I need to uninstall it. I already have that shit on lockdown, so I'm basically just jerking myself off
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:54): Better to force myself to work on all of my weak areas
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 12:55): is that the one thing you would attribute to ur level of mastery in text game?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 12:56): Tinder?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 13:03): Being obsessed with language, reading red pill theory/evolutionary psychology literature for over a year, not giving a fuck
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:05): So Tinder
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:05): define obsessed btw
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:05):  i think reading a couple blogs after finding the material is pretty normal
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:05): par for the course
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:05): 








obsess |əbˈses| verb


preoccupy or fill the mind of (someone) continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent: (as adj. obsessed)
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:06): that pretty much defines your life Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:07): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:09): my roommate Jordan went on his first date in 3 years last night from tinder
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:09): this is what he said about it "we made out, she was okay"
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:09) (1x <3): alpha as shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 13:18): I didn't work for a year and read game and red pill material all day
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 13:18): I would say that is an example of obsession
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:26) (1x <3): 








"So when a man cracks a joke teasing the girl, he is demonstrating a sense of affability -- in the girl's mind. That's the treatment she is used to from her closest friends. It is behavior that is reflective of people who care for her. Her friends call her slut and bitch to her face -- her enemy validates her and goes on, not revealing her intentions or feelings, calling her a bitch behind her back (sound like a beta?)."
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 13:27): What's that from
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:27): Confessions of a Beta: Volume 1
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:28): just a post on the red pill sub reddit
Phillatio (2013-11-19 13:28): well worded and makes sense 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:29): Men: talk shit to each others face but don't mean it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 13:29): Women: compliment to each others face but don't mean it
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 13:49): My hand, your mouth, or my GUN, your FACE

Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:01): she was really cute
Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:01): I guess I should 
Nate (2013-11-19 14:17): they all say that
Nate (2013-11-19 14:17) (1x <3): when you're there you're only interested in a 'friendly' makeout
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 14:18) (3x <3): I'm only interested in a friendly date rape.

Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 14:52): I've gotten that before...
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 14:52): Usually from chicks w/ boyfriends
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 14:57): She might be saying that because she's a lesbian
Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:57): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:58): I don't think so
Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:58): she's just very shy and european
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 14:58): Phil, if u were in troll mode
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 14:59): it would be funny to play dumb as to what "friendly" means
Phillatio (2013-11-19 14:59): lol

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:03): "I'll let you know tmw".....i wonder if Europeans actually follow through more so than their American sisters
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:03): I doubt it
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:04): they're slightly more reliable in my experience
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:04): but not much
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:05): this just means I get to day game more and meet more awesome chicks

Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:10): Little bit of column A, little bit of column B!
Nate (2013-11-19 15:10): Not sure the best way to answer this
Nate (2013-11-19 15:10): haha
Nate (2013-11-19 15:10): okay
Nate (2013-11-19 15:10): serious?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:10): Not really, but it would be hilarious to send
Nate (2013-11-19 15:11): I'd like to keep the flirty vibe, but don't want to piss her off or seem reactive
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:11): she's good
Nate (2013-11-19 15:11): russian
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:11): "mostly"

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:35): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:35) (2x <3): @Phillatio I suggested it, haha
Nate (2013-11-19 15:36): @Xander should I say it again?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:37): Are you actually afraid of losing the set?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:37): Detach yourself and say it one more time
Nate (2013-11-19 15:37): I sent "Yes"
Nate (2013-11-19 15:37): Actually not afraid of losing the set as much as curious of the right moves
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:37): lollllllllllllll 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:37): Nate = OP

Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:38): that's for you Nate
Nate (2013-11-19 15:39): More about checking my instincts
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:40): We're not worthy!
Nate (2013-11-19 15:41) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/de205fd033880131a94422000ae848a8
Nate (2013-11-19 15:41) (1x <3): muahaha
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:42) (1x <3): I have trouble not hearing your voice when I read what you write Nate
Nate (2013-11-19 15:43): I really do have no idea what the best direction to go is now though, this is my first time destroying a girl like that
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:43): but yeah that's flippin awesome
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:43) (1x <3): now that she's all soft, squishy and vulnerable you basically own her
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:44) (3x <3): @Nate Welcome to my world. Girls nonstop apologizing for make believe shit
Nate (2013-11-19 15:44): After they apologize like this, what do you say after?  I'm new to this :)
Nate (2013-11-19 15:45): and light headed from winning
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:46): tell her she can make it up to you 
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:46): by showing off some of her strip moves
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:47): Haha
Nate (2013-11-19 15:48): I'm guessing that's a troll ;)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:49): my mind has been fuc.ked by reading Nate's text chain
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:49): makes no sense that she apologized
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:49): Trolling = seducing
Nate (2013-11-19 15:50): @xander so you really think I should go in that direction?
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:50): yeah I kinda do
Nate (2013-11-19 15:50): @pippy the rest of that text chain had me constantly having her qualify herself to me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:51): lol i re-read it again
Nate (2013-11-19 15:52): I didn't post all of it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:52): still cant fathom how it went from her asking if you were joking or insulting her, to her apologizing to u for insulting u
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:52): yeah it mostly doesn't make sense
Phillatio (2013-11-19 15:53) (1x <3): I'm pretty sure her female hamster spun so fast she got confused and decided to appologize 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:53): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:53): It's the terseness
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:53): He went from being more verbose to terse. She's interpreting that as him being displeased with her
Nate (2013-11-19 15:54): I'm also taking much longer to respond...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:54): incredible
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:54): Incredible? No. Predictable.
Nate (2013-11-19 15:55): It makes sense what he's saying, although I would not have predicted that.  mind open
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:55): ya i guess
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:55): the convo did a 180, caught off guard
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 15:56): but nice work Nate
Nate (2013-11-19 15:56): mostly xander
Nate (2013-11-19 15:56): and phil
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 15:56): I dunno, I'm used to somehow turning situations where I'm the one who messed up into her apologizing
Nate (2013-11-19 16:01): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/9e455510338b0131420b22000aef140c
Nate (2013-11-19 16:01): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/afebea80338b0131420b22000aef140c
Nate (2013-11-19 16:01): I have no idea what the fuck she means
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:01) (4x <3): how is she going to know how much more awesome you are today if you don't give her the range of 20-30%
Nate (2013-11-19 16:03): Any of you understand what she meant there?  Does she not want me to text her, or does she want me to ask her out? lol
Nate (2013-11-19 16:03): I'm tempted to do ...
Nate (2013-11-19 16:03): but I'm trying to figure out what she meant there first
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:03): Assume the sale, Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:04): ya i think she wants u to be bold here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:04): especially if she is russian
Nate (2013-11-19 16:04): you mean ask her out right there?  Wouldn't I be falling into her frame?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:04): point, counter-point
Nate (2013-11-19 16:05): okay I will
Nate (2013-11-19 16:05): I'm free tonight, but that sounds desperate.  Maybe I should go for Sunday instead.  Not asking her ass out on a weekend and the rest of my week is full
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:06): I would go simple in this instance
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:06): text a day 
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:06): BROOKLYN ON SATURDAY
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:06): WE MEET
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:06): !

Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:09): I wanna day game, instadate and then bang another girl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:09): ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:09): weird

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:11): idk man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:11): she put periods at the end of her sentences. it expresses some sort of finality on her part
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:11): Wait, why didn't you do "You can make it up to me. Solas Sunday @ 8" or something like that?
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:11): she's looking for a reasction
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:11): Why just the one sentence?
Nate (2013-11-19 16:11) (2x <3): I dunno, I'm new to this!
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:12) (1x <3): At this point, I would almost just text "lol"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:12): ohhhhhhhhh
Nate (2013-11-19 16:12): okay
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:12): Xander, you insidious madman, you
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:12): THIS IS CLOSERS
Nate (2013-11-19 16:13): Gotta go to the hospital for recovery, my phone will be on tho to this, especially if she keeps going :)
Nate (2013-11-19 16:13): well 'when' she keeps going
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:13): she might
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:13): if she doesn't
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:13): I don't think Elle liked the way that I just flaked on our date
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:14): ?
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:14) (2x <3): Me: "I don't think I can do our museum excursion today..."
Her: "That's okay"
Me: "My girlfriends are starting to get jealous"
Her: NO REPLY
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:14): lol

Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:15): she has a boyfriend
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:15): why does she give a shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:15): I know, haha
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:15): did she say "No Reply"
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:15) (1x <3): Because girls are completely irrational and self-centered
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:15): @Pippy Nah. She hasn't texted back anything
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:15): I think not
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 16:16): ok understood

Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:19): Yeah, I knew immediately that we weren't going to whatever party he was talking about as soon as he invited us
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 16:19): Wtf
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 16:20): This kid must have a golden shower fetish - last friday he was telling me another story where he peed on some guy...
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:20): he just mentioned another story about that in gaylife
Phillatio (2013-11-19 16:21): I don't get how you accidentally pee on someone
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:23): I like how most of the guys in GayLife immediately shut up when you poke fun at them too
Jimmyayo (2013-11-19 16:23): He's just asserting his dominance on his weaker siblings 
Marcus (2013-11-19 16:45): Anyone daygaming 
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 16:46): Meh

Nate (2013-11-19 18:10): I'm channeling Xander a lot lately
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:11): not bad
Nate (2013-11-19 18:11): Honestly I don't mind doing it a little earlier, but I'm not catering to 'I'm lazy'
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:12): oh I wouldn't cater to her just because
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:12): hard to see where it goes from here
Nate (2013-11-19 18:13): No idea
Nate (2013-11-19 18:13): I'll probably change it to 7pm, but I want her to work for it
Nate (2013-11-19 18:14): Don't really care about this chick anyway, keep trying to replace her on Sunday :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:14) (1x <3): @Marcus Are you still in the city?
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:15): going home mah niggs
Nate (2013-11-19 18:16) (3x <3): Number closed another russian.  Did my opener, she said thanks and started walking, I just kept talking, she stopped, turned around, I closed half the distance...
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:16) (2x <3): Marcus if you want to join me while I find the tallest building to jump off of please do
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:16): @Phillatio Sayonara
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:16): Maybe we can time our jumps, Phil
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:17) (1x <3): we'll have to synchronize watches
Nate (2013-11-19 18:17) (3x <3): She said she was going home.  I said we'll have a drink.  She said "okay let's go".  I said not now I can't.  Give me your number.  She said "You are very bold/couragous/something".  She gave me her number.
Phillatio (2013-11-19 18:17): damn I would have loved to get a drink with her
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:17) (1x <3): @Nate I'm almost thinking you should have dropped the "My dad has cancer" line
Nate (2013-11-19 18:17): I would too but I have to go visit my father in recovery later and I wasn't doing it drunk
Nate (2013-11-19 18:17): I didn't explain myself
Nate (2013-11-19 18:19): She was buzzed too.  I texted her "Until our drink, enjoy drunk".  She immediately texted back 'cool'
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:19): Then you just leave it there
Nate (2013-11-19 18:19): yep
Nate (2013-11-19 18:20): my next text will be time and place we are meeting

Nate (2013-11-19 18:25) (1x <3): @marcus if you have the cash I could send you to the broker that helped me find my place
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:26) (1x <3): @Marcus It's okay, I've been living out of my suitcase for months

Nate (2013-11-19 18:32) (1x <3): out of surgery and groggy.  It all went well I think, although he has to wait a week or so to see if he'll need to do chemo also
Marcus (2013-11-19 18:34) (2x <3): Good to hear. I hope he makes a full recovery
Nate (2013-11-19 18:36) (1x <3): Thanks

Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:41) (1x <3): We just shipped a build today that's getting reviewed, so... hopefully by the end of the week...

Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:43): They don't prepay you an entire $120,000
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:43): They prepay a part of it
Nate (2013-11-19 18:43): Yeah but your boss should at least forward you enough money to pay for food
Marcus (2013-11-19 18:46): I agree
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:51): Well, I can eat all of my meals here if I feel life
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 18:52): I just ate dinner here, for instance

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 20:04): interesting
Nate (2013-11-19 20:04): Not sure if it was the best choices, but it worked
Nate (2013-11-19 20:05): When she mentioned architecture I changed the subject because work is boring
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 20:06) (1x <3): I should stop trolling my ex girlfriend, poor girl ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f6bc7ce033ad0131a94422000ae848a8

Nate (2013-11-19 20:12): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 20:12): Dave is some guy who she's been pining after. He claims to be "emotionally schizophrenic", lol
Nate (2013-11-19 20:12): lol
Nate (2013-11-19 20:13): would it be a mistake to say something like "not that easy to get into my apartment" or is that too obvious?
Nate (2013-11-19 20:14): or skip the apartment line and just say "We will be there"
Nate (2013-11-19 20:14): or some other direction
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 20:17): I dunno know right now man
Xander Xone (2013-11-19 20:17): I'm exhausted
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 20:17): Nate, saying "Yes" worked earlier lol
Nate (2013-11-19 20:17): well it's not that close to my apartment :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 20:21): Xander, legit curious as to what she did that altered his intimacy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-19 20:21): altho u did mention ex gf so thats quite ok if u dont want to "go there"

Marcus (2013-11-19 23:19): Approached a women (late 30s) right after I got off the path. she told me that she's 2x my age haha. She walked with me from my station to right outside my place - but then a stupid taxi showed up ~ fucking A anyways fun times
Nate (2013-11-19 23:21): #1 thing I learned with older women.  Any argument of age is bullshit
Marcus (2013-11-19 23:26) (1x <3): Lol I was I'm 14 don't u see my backpack.. And you are a senior citizen with a 5‰ discount. Going far is way better - she Didnt mention the age again.
Nate (2013-11-19 23:27) (1x <3): Should have said "come inside for a drink and then grab a taxi"
Marcus (2013-11-19 23:33): I was 'come inside, my doorman will find u a taxi' ~ as a taxi rolls up 
Nate (2013-11-19 23:34): aww

Marcus (2013-11-19 23:39): Nate how has it day been

Marcus (2013-11-19 23:40): OK so my phone changes ur to it
Marcus (2013-11-19 23:43): Look at the positives not the negatives. Always think about the glass being half full not half empty

Mark (2013-11-20 10:23) (1x <3): Aint exactly the four seasons

Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 10:26): Is that cup the remainder of a gold shower session?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 10:26): *golden*
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 10:28): Where you going after Chile mark?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 10:47): Question for the group
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 10:48): If you just met a chick and talked about grabbing coffee, would it be too much too early to re-neg and ask her out to a concert instead? 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 11:09): why the concert and not the coffee
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 11:09): does this girl queef gold dust?

Phillatio (2013-11-20 11:32) (1x <3): should probably do some day game

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 11:40) (2x <3): are u feeling 15-20% more awesome today or just 10-15%, that might be allll the difference
Phillatio (2013-11-20 11:43): lol 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 11:43) (1x <3): Must be a good hair day Phil. Strike when the iron is hot! 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 11:43) (1x <3): probably about 22.3% more awesome with a 5% margin of error
Phillatio (2013-11-20 11:44) (1x <3): oo I actually like that as a ping text
Phillatio (2013-11-20 11:44): indeed my closer bro Jimmy

Marcus (2013-11-20 11:52): lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 12:12) (1x <3): When its too cold for streetgame, grand central is your bff
Nate (2013-11-20 12:13): it's not too cold for street game, just not particularly pleasant
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 12:13) (1x <3): But I'm a pussy 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 12:13): So THERE
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:14): Nate is the Chewbacca of cold street game
Nate (2013-11-20 12:15): Rawwrraawwrrr
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 12:15): Mmmnnnnwahh
Nate (2013-11-20 12:16) (1x <3): Hit on this gorgeous midwestern blonde on the way to work, so awesome.  Unfortunately boyfriend.  We were holding hands for about 5 minutes.
Nate (2013-11-20 12:16): I wanted to marry this chick right on the spot, damn
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:16): incredible
Nate (2013-11-20 12:17): I told her to break up with her boyfriend, and then come wait on that exact spot we left at until I showed up
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:18): so romantic
Nate (2013-11-20 12:18): I know, I'm such a lady killer
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:18): tell her you're going to wear a mask until you meet again
Nate (2013-11-20 12:18): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:19): don juan game style
Nate (2013-11-20 12:19): My date tonight is on the edge of flake.  Getting over a cold and not sure if she's coming
Nate (2013-11-20 12:19): she has until 4 and then I'm gonna see if the russian I met last night will meet me instead
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:20): noice nice
Nate (2013-11-20 12:20): Plan C I come find phil and drag his ass outside to do daygame
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:20): noice nice
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:21) (1x <3): please do
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 12:21) (1x <3): Pretty gangsta nate
Nate (2013-11-20 12:22): well yes there may be some beatdown to go with it, as is required
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:22): How did the meet with the Russian go nate-daw?
Nate (2013-11-20 12:23): What meet?
Nate (2013-11-20 12:24): I met 2 russians.  One I have a date with Monday and the other I met last night.  I got her to want to have an instadate, but I turned it down because I thought I was going to see my pops at the hospital, which didn't actually happen...
Nate (2013-11-20 12:24): I got her number thoi
Nate (2013-11-20 12:24) (1x <3): "Hey dad, you look like shit.  I got drunk waiting for you"
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:25): nice
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:25): oh not nice that
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:25): I wanna do an instadate
Nate (2013-11-20 12:25): yeah I probably could have plowed that russian chick last night, she was already drunk when I met her
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:25): I've never been on one
Nate (2013-11-20 12:26): @phil all it takes is find a girl that's not doing anything at the time you find her, and say "Hey let's get a drink, I know a great place nearby"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:26): SRU was big in helping me realize that they are possible 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:26): JTB and Jimmy too
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:26): yeah true
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:26): o it
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:26): I know I could do it**
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:26): if I wanted to
Nate (2013-11-20 12:27): Of course you can
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:27): ya, the mindset is difficult to embrace since daygame is about opening getting the number and setting it up. Once you do it once Phil, you will open your eyes a bit
Nate (2013-11-20 12:27): You still have a really small sample size of day game approaches.  Only reason you haven't.
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:27): yeah well 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:27): I feel pretty good about day game
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:27): since I got two dates out of one session
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:27): and banged a girl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:27): props
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:28): ;)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:28): hearing stories from this chat is a huge motivator, personally
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:28) (1x <3): oh good cause I always feel like I'm bragging, because I am
Nate (2013-11-20 12:28): @phil Yeah you are strong in midgame conversation.  You'll probably have more success than I do pretty quickly
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:29): lol we'll see
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:29): you're still the day game guru 
Nate (2013-11-20 12:29): :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:29): Nate, it's impressive your ability to open and open strong
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:30): Daily Dose of Beta: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r254f/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriendf_27_f_gf_asked/
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:31) (1x <3): not reading...
Nate (2013-11-20 12:31): yeah that russian I got last night was literally all strong opening and domination.  There was no conversation
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:31): Nate, starting out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:31): howd u get to point to open like that, u said u kept talking even as she kept walking at first
Nate (2013-11-20 12:32): I did, she started walking away and I just kept going louder.  She turned slightly and I kept talking, looked at her like "come here" and crossed half way to her and she did the same back
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:33): right
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:33): yeah Nate has got the approach down flate
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:33): flat* 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:33): plants his feet and talks loud
Phillatio (2013-11-20 12:33): high energy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:34): one issue is the feel that everyone will stop and listen and judge
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:34): such a stupid ratioanlization but damn
Nate (2013-11-20 12:34): @pippy Literally the only judgement I've ever gotten was awe and respect
Nate (2013-11-20 12:35) (1x <3): Had grandmothers, dudes, old guys, women walk up to me and say some variation of "that took balls"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 12:35): such a stupid ratioanlization but damn
Nate (2013-11-20 12:36): Also this is new york, people are used to seeing random people saying shit all the time and don't really pay attention to it

Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:26): Gents, almost everything that comes from Nick TDS i agree with wholeheartedly
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:27): (The Dating Specialist)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:27): And this is one of the best, succinct articles on texting I've ever read
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:27): http://www.thedatingspecialist.com/blog/15-texting-mistakes-that-stop-you-from-getting-the-date/
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:27): Please read when you have a moment
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:30): oh yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:30): I read that earlier
Nate (2013-11-20 13:30) (1x <3): @jimmy yeah you had the one and only person to ever be a dick to someone during daygame
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:30): I agree but its beyond what I need
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:30): I mean below what I need
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:31): although I sorta disagree with number 2
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:45): I've definitely lost chicks by waiting too long to text back. I know its anecdotal but true
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 13:48): " If you don’t want a girl to play games with you, you shouldn’t be playing games with her."
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 13:48): why
Nate (2013-11-20 13:48): someone has never met girls...
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:49): idk I mean there's a small amount of truth to that I think. but only just
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:50): I think what's more true is if you don't want a girl to play games with you play so many girl games with her that you flip the script and she chases you
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 13:50): @WHy @ Phil for disagreeing with number 2
Nate (2013-11-20 13:51) (2x <3): or the first time she tries to play games you destroy her mind and spirit and make her a quivering sex slave

Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:54): I'm not gonna ask her again 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 13:54): she knows the offer is out there
Nate (2013-11-20 13:55) (1x <3): "maybe we can meet up tomorrow" - so alpha
Nate (2013-11-20 13:56) (2x <3): "Thursday is my last day here, so here is what's going to happen.  We are going to <bar> at <time> and we will have an amazing time, because I will be there"
Nate (2013-11-20 13:57): :)

Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 14:51): He definitely tried, the most he got was a couple BJs.

Phillatio (2013-11-20 17:59): and I realized that you can still eat pussy and be dominant. Like the other day I ate Maria out as she was getting dressed. I pushed her down on the bed and ripped her panties aside then as I ate her out I held her down with my other hand  
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:00): and when she was cumming I still held her down 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:00): and made her endure a little over her comfort 
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:01): so thus anyone who says that eating pussy is beta is full of shit
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:02): was reading this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1r31uy/poll_how_many_of_you_still_eat_pussy/
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:02): Also, I did it at the end after she spent 30 minutes giving me head
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:04): If Dimitri the Lover does eats pussy, it can't be beat
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:04): *beta
Phillatio (2013-11-20 18:05): yeah also that

Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:44): 3/7 responses so far
Nate (2013-11-20 18:44): To dead numbers?
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:44): Well, mostly dead
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:44): Mostly.
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:45): There's that one bitch who was friends with the blonde from Solas that Phil fingerblasted on his roof
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:45): I mean, seriously. What a cunt!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 18:48): The nerve o' deez bitched
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:48) (1x <3): I'm gonna track her down and rape her
Nate (2013-11-20 18:49): @Xander did you just send the pic, or did you use a caption?
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:49): I just sent the pic
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:49): Okay, make that 4/7
Nate (2013-11-20 18:50): what are the responses?
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:50): I'm going to send a second wave to my super dead leads in a little bit
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:50): Okay, 5/7
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:51): Hot Filipino girl sent me back a picture of a sleeping grumpy cat 
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:53): Colombian girl: ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/de47b370346c0131a94422000ae848a8
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:53): Come on, that setup is too easy
Nate (2013-11-20 18:53): That doesn't look like a cat...
Nate (2013-11-20 18:53): haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:54): The picture preceding it was a cat
Nate (2013-11-20 18:54): ahh
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:55): Some blonde chick from Tinder was like, "A/S/L" so I told her "14/f/Philippines"
Nate (2013-11-20 18:55): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:56): Crazy 33 year old dance instructor sent me "Hahahaha" "Love it"
Nate (2013-11-20 18:59): what made her crazy?
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 18:59): Entitled much? ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/c45d4ad0346d0131a94522000ae848a8
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:00): The fact that she's basically manic and insecure and talking about being the mistress of multimillionaire/billionaires
Nate (2013-11-20 19:01): sounds like a good full time job
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:03): I mean, why would they be hanging out with her? She's pretty, but definitely nothing beyond a quickly-aging 8. They can afford to be surrounded by young, beautiful snatch
Nate (2013-11-20 19:04): low self esteem?  no social skills?
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:04): That's what makes me think that she's lying
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:04) (1x <3): I've seen it all lately.
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:04): The world is one big joke!
Nate (2013-11-20 19:04): True
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:11): Okay, it's up to 6/7 responses
Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:11): I love how all of the Spanish speaking chicks are the most confused

Xander Xone (2013-11-20 19:34): “Human relationships didn't work anyhow. Only the first two weeks had any zing, then the participants lost their interest. Masks dropped away and real people began to appear: cranks, imbeciles, the demented, the vengeful, sadists, killers. Modern society had created its own kind and they feasted on each other. It was a duel to the death--in a cesspool.”

Nate (2013-11-20 23:04): @pippy I find asians have different cultures that respond differently
Nate (2013-11-20 23:05) (1x <3): I'm a little tired of asians though because as a whole they tend to be more conservative unless they are from here
Nate (2013-11-20 23:06): Course my date tomorrow is asian
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:06): They require more comfort than attraction; westerners require the opposite
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:06): Jimmy, u gotta enter a 1 on the spreadsheet
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:06): Lol Nate thanks for sharing

Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:08): No but talk about yourself, let them feel like ur a normal human being 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:08): Talk about ur family
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:08): Foreal? I feel like Asian girls are more in-tune with Asian men
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:09): i've dated 2 asians so i'm not sweating asian fever so much.  Wonder how much of my shiz is a limiting belief
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:09): Hobbies, opinions, whatever. They require less 'game' and more realtalk
Nate (2013-11-20 23:09) (1x <3): @pippy all of it, you just answered your own question
Nate (2013-11-20 23:10): @jimmy what about kino, sexual conversation.  How long should I be waiting to do that?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:10): Nate, fuck you, and thank you for the honesty

Nate (2013-11-20 23:15): I'm hoping for a freaky asian tomorrow, we'll see tho, looks can be deceiving
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:21): I hope so too! just remember: 1) don't scare her off by getting too freaky too fast, 2) make her feel comfortable by you being comfortable,  talking about whatever u want to talk about 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:22): Jimmy knows
Jimmyayo (2013-11-20 23:24): And for your sake I hope she's not Korean 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:25): whoa whoa

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-20 23:28): But....Jimmy....

Xander Xone (2013-11-20 23:34): I'm going to have to thank D-money for inspiring my cluster bomb of texts today
D-money (2013-11-21 01:28): I feel happy to have contributed something, usually I just ask questions!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:16): Guys i want to share a daily dose of game

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:16): "I might go out with some friends that night...not sure so I'll let you know!" [shit test response]
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:16): Problem: This shit test is the final resistance in the 
text game when women will try to 1) one-up you in the status department 
and 2) make you beg for a meeting. 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:16): Solution: I have had great success with the 
following response, and one of my friends I'm mentoring in RP also had a
 nice trial with it. Something along the lines of:




Translation: So you actually have no plan at all. Then we are still on for [insert night] at 9 pm. Pick you up there.


Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:17): One of the comments from a girl is hella-enlightening
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:17): [–]Derpina42 5 points 1 hour ago
Truth
 is: When I ask you a question or say something provoking I already 
have, in my mind, constructed your perfect answer. The "shit-test" is 
all about how close to it you get. It's a way for me to deduce if you 
are "worth my time/respect". It sounds horrible, I know. And in all 
honesty it's cruel and devious. I do this almost subconsciously, though. 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:17):  also do this to show that you need to meet a certain standard (shown
 by your answer) to get to me. That is an attempt to raise my value, so 
that I do not come across as "cheap".

In the very few instances where the real answer overshadows my 
construction I feel it in my panties, so to speak. I always analyze your
 answers - because you are a mystery for me to solve. You do not speak 
much, guys.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:17): Everything you say can and will be used against you. in the OP's case 
the answer breathe persistence, confidence and interest in me. He also 
shows that he sees the "real me".  He sees past the bullshit of "what if
 I try to play hard to get with him? Surely he will get bored and 
dissappear".
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:17): No matter your intent - this is a great response to such a test. Because it says (to a girl) so much more than just the words typed. 
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:17): Most girls don't use shit tests consciously
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:18): im not arguing that, not sure if u are either, but recognized
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:18): but the girls' take on it is interesting
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:18): and i like the text response
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:18): Translation: So you actually have no plan at all. Then we are still on for [insert night] at 9 pm. Pick you up there.

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:18): Fuck, if i had a vagina that would give me tingles reading that
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:18): Just the "I have already constructed the perfect answer" makes it sound like she's some intentional master of mindfuckery
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:19): Sounds like her own retroactive rationalization
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:19): ya ya could be, or she is just cognizant of her own stuff
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:29): "I might go out with some friends that night...not sure so I'll let you know!"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:29): The text response to that: 
Translation: So you actually have no plan at all. Then we are still on for [insert night] at 9 pm. Pick you up there.

Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:30): I'm pretty sure we've all said something similar to that 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:31): Well I have anyway
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:31): lol Guilty as Charges
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:31): fuc.k it
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:32): I've gone with the "Nope. See you there at ____"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:32): And it's worked pretty well

Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:34): So in that comment from the female:

"what if
 I try to play hard to get with him? Surely he will get bored and 
dissappear"

Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:34): So she is saying, if he DOES get bored and disappears, that's failing the shit test?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:36): nah nah, she is saying that if u send a text similar to the one suggested, it communicates that you're the kind of guy that will get bored and disappear if she plays hard to get
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:37): Yes?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:37): yes
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:37): Oh, hm

Nate (2013-11-21 10:51): No rush, don't really care beyond the fun of practice with someone like that
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:52): Lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 10:52): Pippy, no response from teri
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:52): (sigh)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:52): she's still thinking of an awesome way to respond, that's all

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:57): shit Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 10:57) (1x <3): While you were playing opposite day I was out trolling motherfuckers for their feels and lunch money
Nate (2013-11-21 10:58): Pippy do this:  Send a message to that girl "I love you, why won't you reply", send it 40 times.
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 10:58): I'm upset. There has been a whole lot of beta mucking up this thread lately

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:02): It seems like if you go down that road, it could lead to misogyny
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:02): good.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 11:02): some misogyny is a good thing
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 11:02): I'm concerned about some of the red pill ideas
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:03): But don't you want to find a good woman to love? How can you do that with red pill ideals?
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:03): (Don't know how long I can keep up this concern trolling)
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:03): not long apparentely 
Nate (2013-11-21 11:03) (1x <3): @Xander the funny part of your trolling is there is always an element of your truth in what your saying...
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:04): its only the counter argument to red pill
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:05): which is easily squashed under my misogynist boot
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:05): That's why girls hate it when I poke fun at them. "I can never tell if you're serious or not!"
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:06): I'm going down the rabbit hole hard.
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:06): There is always that kernel of truth, which I use as a shiv to their fragile egos.
Nate (2013-11-21 11:06): Girls are dumb, I can always tell...
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:06) (1x <3): @Phillatio I'm waiting for you down here at the bottom
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:08): @Nate Not always. My greatest trolls are the ones that are never discovered
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:08): the smart girls are the ones that red pill works the best on. 
Nate (2013-11-21 11:09): I'll give you most of the time then so you feel better
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:13): why are they marking things nsfw that are not at all on reddit
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:13): its like a video of a snake

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:15): Did you space out again in the middle of talking to her?
Marcus (2013-11-21 11:15): She is an old number close that I never had time to meet up with

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:34): $12? Way too much
Marcus (2013-11-21 11:37): That steak looks good.. $12 sounds cheap for a good steak with eggs
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:38): I'm a puer aeternus

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:38): You have to be kidding me
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 11:38): Were they golden eggs?
Nate (2013-11-21 11:39): I can get a dozen eggs for like 4 bucks in manhattan
Phillatio (2013-11-21 11:46) (3x <3): I can get a dozen eggs pregnant for free
Marcus (2013-11-21 11:47): It was by weight $8 a lb

Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:24) (1x <3): time to delete the app
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:24) (1x <3): and focus on day game
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:24) (2x <3): I did 2 approaches last night with Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:26): where at
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:26): how'd it go
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:26): it went shitty
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:26): how'd it go is a shitty situation if judging on how the interaction went
Nate (2013-11-21 12:26) (1x <3): I number closed a girl on the way home from you phil.  Not sure how live it is, she was really hot hipstery girl who seemed slightly nuts
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:26): so more curious to know how it went for you, in terms of pushing ur comfort zone
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:26): @Phil^^^
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:27): sounds like a dream come true @Nate
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:27) (1x <3): Yep. I'm going to finish up my current Tinder leads, do one big bombing run of old Tinder leads and then delete it. No more swiping
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:27): Just because there are some actually hot chicks who I'm currently talking to
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:27) (1x <3): It went well I'm getting more comfortable with it
Nate (2013-11-21 12:27): @phil depends on if she's a live one.  I sent her a text right after I left her so she had my name.  Will text her tomorrow.
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:27): I record every single approach
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:27): I guess it was bound to happen after swiping through 20,000 girls
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:27): @Phil
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:28): one thing Jimmy and I are doing is a 30 Day Accountability challenge
Nate (2013-11-21 12:28): She didn't reply to my text, but that's no real indication
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:28): google drive spreadsheet, all u gotta do is put the amount of approaches u did that day (0,1, or 2) where 2 is the goal
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:28): at the end of the week, we have a "Bitch of the Week", so if u did 0 approaches for 3 days....the stipulation is you're going to buy the Sunday dinner that week
Nate (2013-11-21 12:28): @pippy raise the high number to 6
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:28): idk, it's not that intense but can keep u sharp
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:28): I'm good right now with 2 Nate-dawg
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:29): today this girl was like standing uncomfortably near me
Nate (2013-11-21 12:29): You can do 2 in like 5 minutes
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:29): she was right in my face
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:29): and she had room
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:29): super cute blond too
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:29): and I didn't talk to her cause I'm a bitch
Nate (2013-11-21 12:29) (2x <3): Yeah, bitch
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:30): Nate
I can do 2 in like 5 minutes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:30): *Fixed
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:30): Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I turned a booty call down last night
Nate (2013-11-21 12:30): Why?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:30): so Phil, maybe u and Xander consider doing soemthing liek that.  Nate is a goddam.n machine
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:32): he doesn't need it
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:32): maybe
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:32): except I'll win
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:32): and feel bad taking Xander's money
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:32): while 6 approaches via Nate will get u better quicker
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:32): ;-)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:33): 2 is manageable, doesn't put  a lot of stress, still gets u out there and doing it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:33): so, sleep on that
Nate (2013-11-21 12:33): Well the point is to give you some stress
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:33): right
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:34) (1x <3): Now that I'm officially below the poverty line, I have to win
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:34): nice ^
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:34): Nate
Well the point is to give you some stress
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:34): @Phillatio - subway?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:34): Ya Nate but I don't want to trudge my ass to Grand Central knowing i have to do 6 approaches
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:34): this morning yeah ^
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:34): im prob not going to do it then
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:34) (1x <3): subway approaches are so stressful 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:35): Challenge for today/tomorrow, for Closers:
Nate (2013-11-21 12:35): @pippy you'll be less selective, more likely to get comfortable with them.  When you only do 2 you take tons of time agonizing, passing up good ones, and being nervous for each one.  Larger numbers = more comfort
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:35) (1x <3): Do 1 subway approach
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:36): Gauge awkwardness of the situation
Nate (2013-11-21 12:36): That means I have to take the subway...
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:36): I can agree and disagree with that assessment Nate. 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:37): I don't like doing large numbers
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:37): it takes the fun out of it
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:37): that goes for night and day game
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:37): Nate, i hear u bro and thanks for the feedback
Nate (2013-11-21 12:37) (1x <3): 6 is not a large number.   It's also only required if you don't get into successful sets.
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:37) (1x <3): I'll run some street game tonight with y'all
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:38) (1x <3): Nate
6 is not a large number for ME.  Because I am a daygame animal with over a thousand approaches under my belt
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:38): Fixed
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:39): true story 
Nate (2013-11-21 12:39): @pippy that is precisely how I became a daygame animal.  For a while I became completely unselective in who I approached.  I just approached everywhere
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:39): i know man, i remember u telling us ur story back in july and i was impressed with it then as I am now
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:39): this is akin to u being a world-class strength trainer and expecting my body to take the same amount of stress
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:40): im cool with going to the gym and pushing myself a little bit for now
Nate (2013-11-21 12:40): I'm just trying to impart some of that drive to help you
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:40): ya ya i know.  i defer to ur wisdom on the subject, u have the experience
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:40) (1x <3): So much whining right now
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:40): Save your whining for the field
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:41): LOL 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:41) (2x <3): sure thing Tinderbread man
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:42): Let's ease up on the condescension here boys
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:42): oh that's going to be a challenge 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:43): (fyi that means to look down on someone)
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:43): "








condescension |ˌkändəˈsenCHən| noun


an attitude of patronizing superiority; disdain:"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:43): fucking condescends
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:43): how I live my life 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:43) (1x <3): fucking condiments 
Nate (2013-11-21 12:43): okay I'll stop pushing
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:44): So Xander, Phil....are you guys going to engage in a 30 Day 2-Set Daygame Challenge?   
Nate (2013-11-21 12:44): Phil is leaving on Friday
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:44): helllzzz yeah mah nigga
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:45): but yeah I'm not down for doing any challenges 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:45) (1x <3): but I'm down for any sort of wager 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:46): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/b5e87fd035020131b8cf12313b12cc51
Nate (2013-11-21 12:46): wager...
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:47): not with you Nate
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:47): lol 
Nate (2013-11-21 12:47): damn!
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:47): unless it has to do with sex
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:47): lmao
Nate (2013-11-21 12:47) (3x <3): how about me vs everyone here
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:49): This isn't the chat for mollycoddling people. We're here to help you get better at game, not "feel good"
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:49) (1x <3): I prefer the term 'blow sunshine up your ass'
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:50): lol yeah, lets just talk down to everyone in case our superiority over the newbs in Gotham isn't validating our egos enough
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:50): so if Phil has a bad day in field and gets discouraged, i'm not going to call him a beta-fucktard lol.  I'd rather pump up his self esteem a bit if that's what's needed
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:51) (1x <3): I'd rather you call me a beta-fucktard
Nate (2013-11-21 12:51): @pippy if you want to be realistic except in number of approaches I'm worse than most of this chat in other aspects.  Gotta have something to feel good about :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:51): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:52): Phil i won't call u a beta-fucktard man.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:52): most effective feedback is the “sandwich” approach.  Positive qualities on top, calling out aspects to be improved upon in the middle, concluding with positive qualities at the bottom
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:53): eh idk 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:54): I mean yeah
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:54): in a business
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:54): i'm not going to kick a good man down
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:54): how else would I get back up again
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:54): lol
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:54): coddling only makes me weaker
Nate (2013-11-21 12:55): @pippy what if the man is lying on the coach saying "I don't want to go out, because <excuse>"?
Phillatio (2013-11-21 12:55) (1x <3): nut slap! 
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:55): *couch
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:55): good question Nate
Nate (2013-11-21 12:55) (1x <3): @xander I stick by my words
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:55): I like coach
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:56): and maybe I made a  miscommunication making it seem like I would hug the guy in hopes he would get off the couch
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:56) (1x <3): Like I was getting at before, at least get out in the field before bitching out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:56): Bad Example: "Jesus christ get your lazy ass off the couch.  Your grandfather fought the Japs in WW2 and would roll in his grave if he found out you have become such a beta slob.  While you're on the couch moping, your ex-gf is getting fucked by Sandeep who is out there taking action"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 12:57): Xander, i'm pretty sure everybody in this group goes out in the field and makes approaches
Nate (2013-11-21 12:57) (1x <3): Good example: "I'll get the taser"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:57): For instance, 90% of the battle for working out at the gym is making yourself go there. Once you're there, you're pretty much going to work your ass out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:57): Better Example "I know you're feeling shitty and you need time to get back out there.  it's never easy and it sucks but lets start taking baby steps.  Come with me today for a couplpe hours to Union Square and let's just ask 3 girls where the nearest starbucks is"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:57): Yeah, but people were complaining about it being cold and having to go to Grand Central Station
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 12:58): Once you force yourself to go there, then it's a lot harder to weasel out of approaching
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:58): I'm trying to say that it can be a lot more effective emphasizing with someone then offering constructive criticism
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:58): i've gotten tons of feedback in public speaking, to friends suffering in relationships, etc etc
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:58): You notice patterns after a while
Nate (2013-11-21 12:59): Speaking of forcing myself, going outside now
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 12:59): maybe everyone in here is better equipped to handle the harsh truth.  i prefer to uplift and motivate by being positive
Nate (2013-11-21 12:59): I prefer people be honest with me
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:00): That's not an opposing statement Nate
Nate (2013-11-21 13:00): True
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:00): it aint about lying vs telling the truth tho Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:00): it's about the manner in which u deliver the truth
Nate (2013-11-21 13:00): "non violent communication"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:01): like if Xander is expressing his content with his job, how effective is it to upbraid him for not focusing on it vs understanding his situ and trying help him work thru it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:01): for example
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:01): Why do you even require our support? You know in your heart of hearts whether you bitched out or not in any situation, regardless of what we say
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:01): *positive support
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:01): or if i want to lose weight.  telling me to get my fat ass in the gym vs being positive and applauding steps towards increasing weight loss
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:01): I mean, I'd rather people tell me to man up and start looking for another job
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:02) (2x <3): Xander man up and start looking for another job
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:02): i dont require positive support but i see what ur saying.  i'm putting it out there that i'm going to refrain from upbraiding people...i've learned it's better to be positive 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:02) (1x <3): ya sometimes someone deserves a good reality smack
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:02) (1x <3): @Phillatio Been hitting the javascript hard this week
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:03): yeah i guess it's a matter of people learning differently or accepting advice differently
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:03): well lol when u need some softer advice/support u know where to get it
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:04): and when your ass needs a good kicking you know where to get that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:04): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:04): When I look outside, I see an all-out war between the sexes
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:05): I need a soldier to back me up
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:05) (1x <3): I will say that being an asshole to your friends is an awesome way to lose friends. 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:05): That's all
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:06):  agree
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:06): d
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:06): truth (pours a little liquor for lost friends)
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 13:06) (1x <3): I'm not being any more of an asshole than I've ever been, to be fair
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:07) (1x <3): That must be why you're Mister Popular  ;)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:07): OK enough!  Gonna go daygame
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:08): well then..
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 13:08): Time to systematically desensitize this irrational bitch fear
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:08) (1x <3): we're wasting time not banging bitches 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:08): you people do realize that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:11): BTW Fellas

Phillatio (2013-11-21 13:42): gorgeous @Nate
Nate (2013-11-21 13:43): yeah, I'm not optimistic that it will come to anything, but at least I gave it a shot
Nate (2013-11-21 13:44): My two approaches are done for the day :)
TiMex (2013-11-21 13:44): Nate thanks for recos on dates
TiMex (2013-11-21 13:45): Flatiron room was bust last night.
TiMex (2013-11-21 13:45): Walked in and they had some private party going on
TiMex (2013-11-21 13:45): So went to whiskey rebel. Walking distance
Nate (2013-11-21 13:46): How was it?
TiMex (2013-11-21 13:47): Good place. Grabbed a corner seat in the back
Nate (2013-11-21 13:47): THat's what I do

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 13:51): “People can think I’m crazy,” she said. “But they don’t know. This is what’s right for me. This is what I was born for.”
Nate (2013-11-21 13:51): He looks like an old boxer
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 14:21): Dude's also 5'2"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 14:22) (1x <3): ALPHA AS PHUCK
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:02): Yo guys let's have a group challenge 
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:03): Everyone sets goals...  We can have group drinks and the ppl that don't met their goal have to split the bill 
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:03): *Meet their goals
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:04): Its a little unfair for me, Nick and Xander as we live in jersey 
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:04): But I'm willing to take the challenge 
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:10) (1x <3): @Marcus Why is it unfair? That's just a rationalization for not opening people in Jersey
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:11): There is no shortage of cuties walking around in these parts during the day
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:11): Xander I know I'm just being a bitch
Phillatio (2013-11-21 15:12): but they're pumped full of toxins and venereal diseases  
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:12): I found more goals then
Marcus (2013-11-21 15:12): So group challenge 
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:12) (1x <3): @Phillatio They are in NYC too, but they just mask it better
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:15) (4x <3): Aw shit! Abort mission! Abort mission! ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/90b0c71035170131a94522000ae848a8

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:27): I don't even know how I spin that
Nate (2013-11-21 15:27): okay just shoot me now, another flake
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:27): "Yeah, I noticed we were mutual friends. Blah blah blah"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:27): @Nate Can you lend me a gun?
Nate (2013-11-21 15:28): looking for one now
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:28): What the hell do I say to this girl?
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:29): I need to get her off my track
Nate (2013-11-21 15:29): Block
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 15:30): do you really have to answer her question tho
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:30): I think that blocking is just going to make an even bigger deal out of it, haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:48): But yeah, you
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:48): are probably right
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 15:50): A B

Xander Xone (2013-11-21 16:03): I love how that isn't even an oxy moron in this group
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 16:05): lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 16:06): http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/43200851.jpg
Nate (2013-11-21 16:08): That other russian chick I got the number to 2 days ago.  I asked her out last night and she said she was hung over.  I'm guessing it would be a huge mistake to ask her out tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 16:09) (1x <3): You guess correctly
Nate (2013-11-21 16:10) (1x <3): maybe I'll find an instadate tonight
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 16:11): That's the spirit
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 16:11): And so will I
Marcus (2013-11-21 16:25): Nick what is your email
Phillatio (2013-11-21 16:27): nIcK1zAseXgod@yahoo.com
Phillatio (2013-11-21 16:29): Getting some euros homeys
Marcus (2013-11-21 16:30): Nick u don't have gmail
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 16:30): http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/43201557.jpg
Phillatio (2013-11-21 16:33): I've heard it both ways
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 16:43): that was in bad taste man i'm just scraping the barrel here
TiMex (2013-11-21 16:47): Me mark?
Marcus (2013-11-21 16:49): Yes
TiMex (2013-11-21 16:49): Nicksalcedo@yahoo.com
Nate (2013-11-21 16:50) (1x <3): Nick, congradulations.  You have been signed up for "Cat facts"
Marcus (2013-11-21 16:51): U don't have a gmail
TiMex (2013-11-21 16:51): Sweet!
TiMex (2013-11-21 16:51) (1x <3): I was wondering how to get those cat facts
TiMex (2013-11-21 16:51): I do but don't use it
Marcus (2013-11-21 16:56): Dude Gmail is the best. Let me see if it let's u use docs with yahoo
TiMex (2013-11-21 17:13): Ya I can
TiMex (2013-11-21 17:13): Well sorta
TiMex (2013-11-21 17:13): I can sign up for a google account with yahoo email
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:17) (2x <3): Wtf some terrorist just emailed me some shit 
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:18): Haha
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:18): Jimmy shut ur mouth 
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:18): Its a serect
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:19) (1x <3): don't forget the first rule of terrorist club
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:19) (1x <3): Nice patriotic colors, pretending to be American - very smart
Nate (2013-11-21 17:19): blow up terrorist club?
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:22): You know what sucks.. Was trying to help a coworker/friend - the asshole calls me a pick up master in front of other Co workers.  Not helping him anymore. Also doesn't listen when trying to help him. 
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:22) (1x <3): Now, now, hopefully none of us in here need to resort to using blowup dolls
Nate (2013-11-21 17:23): @marcus women will want you more, not less
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:24): I don't think he's concerned about women - it's his colleagues thinking of him as this pickup artist
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:24): Which sucks
Nate (2013-11-21 17:24): yeah, thats supposed to be personal
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:25) (1x <3): I don't try to help anyone
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:25) (2x <3): how about that
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:25) (2x <3): its not worth it and they never listen
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:25): I have a neighbor whom I've tried to help in the past, extreme beta max.  One day he shows up w/ a girl to my apt to hang out, and introduces me as "that pickup guy that i was talking about"
Nate (2013-11-21 17:26): girl instantly ignores him and talks to you
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:26): some people have 0 social sense
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:26): Wow. Jimmy. WTF
Nate (2013-11-21 17:27) (1x <3): "I used to pick things up, but I hurt my back so I only put them down now"
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:27): I don't tell people about this anymore
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:27): So he wasn't interesting enough,  he had to talk about his interesting neighbor. I think she wanted to meet you 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:28): they're always going to judge you on it 
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:28): And like any beta he was being lead to ur place
Nate (2013-11-21 17:29): Well I don't tell people I do pickup, I just say I have an active social life, although I'm not embrarrassed
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:30) (1x <3): I am
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:30) (1x <3): a bit
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:31): Hey guys.. Put ur fucking goal on the sheet
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:31): what fucking sheet
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:32): h that
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:32): We should have short term (daily) goal and long term goal (weekly, monthly) 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:32): oh that*
Nate (2013-11-21 17:32): I'm not sure what goal I should put there that is both achievable and doesn't make me look like a dick
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:32): Or maybe just short term for now like bare min for the day
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:32): don't worry about looking like a dick
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:33): And being in Europe isn't a excuse 
Nate (2013-11-21 17:33): Most of my statistics goals are only achievable if I'm successful, which isn't in the same spirit
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:33): okay my goal is on there
Nate (2013-11-21 17:34) (1x <3): What I really want right now are "1. successful text convo's" "2. NO MORE FLAKES" "3. More dates"
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:34): Nate put having x dates by
Nate (2013-11-21 17:35): okay
Nate (2013-11-21 17:35): I set my goal to 3 dates a week
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:36) (1x <3): Right right, Nate's more concerned about quality interactions, than some metric
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:36): high standards
Nate (2013-11-21 17:36): Gonna have to do a fuckton of approaches to get that right now
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:36): That's good though because he's already hitting high metrics
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:36): It's an appropriate goal given where he is w/ daygame approaching
Nate (2013-11-21 17:36): @jimmy yeah I want my texts and interactions to result in dates
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:36): quality > quantity any fucking day 
Nate (2013-11-21 17:38) (4x <3): why not both?
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:39): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:39): wait nate how are you going to have 12 dates by nov 26th
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:39) (1x <3): that's 5 days away you crazy nigga
Phillatio (2013-11-21 17:39): you gonna have 3 dates a day
Nate (2013-11-21 17:40): oh I read that as dec 26ths
Nate (2013-11-21 17:40): why bother having a goal for 3 days
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 17:41) (1x <3): Date 1 w/ left hand, date 2 w/ right hand?
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:47): @Marcus Nothing wrong with other people DHVing you
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:48): If anyone asks me what the hell I'm out doing, I just say "training to be a life coach"
Nate (2013-11-21 17:49): Nobody has ever asked me what I'm out doing
Nate (2013-11-21 17:49): except the girl, and I say taking a walk, or meeting a friend, or whatever
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:54): I already talked to the kid and he apologized
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:55): I can't wait to delete Tinder at midnight
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:55) (2x <3): I'm thinking at 10pm I might send the final warning to the few remaining prospects that I'm deleting my Tinder at midnight, haha
Marcus (2013-11-21 17:56): Need to cut my hair
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:56) (1x <3): "Last chance to grab a drink with the NYC area's greatest lover and seducer, XANDER THE LOVER!!!"
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:57): @Marcus Yeah right. I need to cut my hair more
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 17:57): And I'm going to get it done tomorrow
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:06): @Xander

The Definitive book of Body of Language

You Say More Than You Think 


Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:06): If you could only pick one which would you read?
Nate (2013-11-21 18:07): I would take the time you would have used to read and go do more day game instead
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:09): Nate unlike you I don't want to make my life 100% daygame approaching but thanks for the tip bro
Xander Xone (2013-11-21 18:14): The former
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:16): Thanks man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:16): I'm going to read it then
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:16): Pippy stop reading and just approach bro
Nate (2013-11-21 18:17): He'd rather be passive aggressive to me instead
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:18): Passive aggressive? Fuck you man, is that better
Nate (2013-11-21 18:18): sure
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-21 18:18): Shit, if you go out of your way to shit on me I'm coming right back with it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:19): Ahhahahahahaha
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:19): you know what happens then
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:19): everyone gets covered in shit
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:19): fun times
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:19): Who slung dung
Nate (2013-11-21 18:19): Actually it was a suggestion because the theory is that you're supposed to do like 90% of practical to 10% of reading, but take it as a personal attack if you want
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:20): I'm thinking of bringing some 1920s slang back
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:20): and sending them in texts
Nate (2013-11-21 18:20): @phil I like that
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:20): zozzled, cat's pajamas, dolled up
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:20): these are fucking great

Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:21) (2x <3): hey toots get yourself dolled up. we're gonna get zozzled tonight it'll be the cats pajamas
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:22): Why are things so fucking tense here today?!
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:22): People need to get laid, it's probably all that backed up semen 
Nate (2013-11-21 18:23): @jimmy I would agree with that
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:23) (2x <3): I've been getting laid
Nate (2013-11-21 18:24): Fuck you Phil!
Phillatio (2013-11-21 18:24) (1x <3): muhaha
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:24): I'm gonna be in the LES later, getting zozzled w/ this new cat "Jad" aka A A tonight around 8pm
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:24): If anybody wants to meet up just let me know
Jimmyayo (2013-11-21 18:26): Home Sweet Home

Phillatio (2013-11-22 00:10) (2x <3): Lol stalking game recognized

Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 03:15) (2x <3): Shit about to habe 3sum

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 10:29) (1x <3): Phil, when u busting out of the US
Phillatio (2013-11-22 10:35): Tonight mah nigga

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 10:35): shit that's cool
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 10:35): i hear traveling solo like that changes u for the better 100%
Phillatio (2013-11-22 11:22): its the only way to travel.
Phillatio (2013-11-22 11:22): At least that's how I always travel
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:07): UGH no 3sum
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:12): http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18nlhgmi4twphgif/original.gif
Nate (2013-11-22 12:16) (1x <3): yeah, probably gonna look for other places to work
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:17): so they said they're gonna fire you 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:17): if you keep doing what you're doing
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:17): ?
Nate (2013-11-22 12:17): not in those words, but all they could say is that I was required to put in the hours, and whether I was getting my work done was unimportant
Nate (2013-11-22 12:18): If I need to keep regular hours, I might as well find a different place to work where I keep regular hours and get paid more
Nate (2013-11-22 12:18): and maybe have something not nearly as boring to work on
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:19): yea
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:19): I hear that
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:19): I didn't go in today
Nate (2013-11-22 12:19) (2x <3): Only real nice thing about this job is the 6 weeks of vacation
Nate (2013-11-22 12:23): Since they aren't going to fire me tomorrow, pretty sure.  I think I'll take my time to find a job that will pay better and still be flexible.  Good motivation
Nate (2013-11-22 12:28) (2x <3): Good time to think maybe I should spend some time and build my own business again.  Gonna have to be a lot more efficient with my time though if I want to do both
Nate (2013-11-22 12:36): @jimmy what stopped the 3some?
Phillatio (2013-11-22 12:37): alcohol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:37): I couldn't extract the two of them from the other chicks they were with
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:38): So we all went out for food afterwards
Nate (2013-11-22 12:38): ahh
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:39): All good, I'm seeing 2 of them later tonight to see a show 
Nate (2013-11-22 12:39): nice, so maybe you'll still get the 3some later :)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:40): Actually I'd be very happy to just fuck this one girl
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:41): Jinnah, the cute korean chick that works the door @ 230 5th - her sister is in town so we were all out last night.  The sister - very sweet and super cute
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:43): So hopefully. Tonight.

Xander Xone (2013-11-22 12:45): Last night, going into 13th Step and Solas reminded me exactly why I'm done with night game
Nate (2013-11-22 12:46): @jimmy you think 230 5th is good place to take a date on a friday evening around 8?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:46): @Xander what happened?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 12:47): Nothing in particular happened. Just got needless bitchiness from 6s. Sloppy drunk girls everywhere, a turn off
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:47): @Nate it's alright. Very early so it's not party-packed. Maybe have 1 drink there and bounce to a better place to isolate/escalate
Nate (2013-11-22 12:47): where is a better place to isolate/escalate?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 12:47): Since it's so spacious and the views are great, you can lead her around 
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 12:49): Okay, so it seems that I have something like 6 number closes from my last hurrah Tinder bombing
Nate (2013-11-22 12:50): @jimmy I don't really know good places to escalate on fridays.  Everywhere is so crowded
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 12:51): Goodbye Tinder. It was nice having known you.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:51): Nate, the downstairs at Zolas (41st and 3rd) also known as La Biblioteca is solid place to escalate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:51): it's probably hella close to ur apt so if u havent 100% committed to union square, omething to think about

Nate (2013-11-22 12:52): have you been there on a friday?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:52): http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GvjlBL9AnQWx7z-gXwSucQ/l.jpg
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:53): Nate, no I have not.  But that's not known to be a bumping spot for Murray Hill
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:53): if you want, you could call and speak to hostess. they are pretty honest about crowdedness
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:53): i've done so in past for thurs night dates and the such
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:57): the place is a great date spot

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:57) (1x <3): ima call him to find out how the crowd was
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 12:58) (1x <3): CACAW!
Nate (2013-11-22 12:58): thanks, I won't send my message until you do
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 12:59): "It was crowded but it was good.  I went there at 7pm and was just able to get one seat at the bar.  It's definitely a perfect place but it has a tendency to get crowded on Friday." -
Nate (2013-11-22 13:00): hmm
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:00): fuck
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:00): Marcelle goes of on her feminist rants 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:01): "MARCELLE:

you don't know what you want, you said that the other day
and aren't you an alpha male
this discussion is finished

Nate (2013-11-22 13:01): @pippy I was gonna go at 8, not sure if I should if we can't get a seat
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:01): I'm this discussion is finished part
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:01): obviously
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:01): Oh, you know what you want alright!
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:02): Poooooosie!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:02): Nate, that's a tough call man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:02): perhaps u can call and make a reservation
Nate (2013-11-22 13:03): Could you ask him how long he stayed?  Some reviews said it thinned out a bit later, I could go later if so
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:04): im asking
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 13:06): Nate yah most midtown places thin out later at night on weekends - most ppl don't party late in midtown
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:08): The response "Ummm thinned out a little, still was crowded though"
Nate (2013-11-22 13:08): Okay thanks 
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:14): I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:14): I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:19) (1x <3): Cause you're a good girl and you know it

Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:23): when wasn't he a fan of drake
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:23): Xander, is that foreal?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:23): i didnt take you as a drake fan, real-talk
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:23): i actually have no idea what kind of music this Chat is into, other than Nate saying he was down for dubstep and hip hop if I recall
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:23): Ahmad likes edm
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:24): I mean, I kinda like his weird rap/singy thing, but it's absolute crap music
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:24) (1x <3): that's why its great
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:24): Exactly
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:24): he is a talented mo fo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:24): I like his non-R&B Songs
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:24): and some where there is R&B are OK
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:24): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikl3A9puiKI
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 13:25): that one being the only example i can think of .  Although it's good primarily because it incorporates the Chopped-N-Screwed style which is from Houston
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:25): @Phillatio Do you ever listen to Beirut, the musical artist?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:25): Since you were looking for some new music
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:26): nope
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:26): I figure that it's up your alley
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:26): Check out their album The Flying Club Cup
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:27): When you talked about stumbling around Europe drunk and playing music in the streets, that's basically what this guy did for a couple years as well
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:28): lol 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 13:28): nice listening now
Nate (2013-11-22 13:29): Hmm, okay looks like I'm having my first late night date in a long time.  Meeting her after her 8pm dinner.  
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:29): I need to retreat to the bathroom so I can coordinate my dates better
Nate (2013-11-22 13:29): @anyone what's good late a night on fridays that I can get into if I wanna make this a late one?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:29): I have like... 6 dates to schedule
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 13:36): @Nate I haven't a clue
Nate (2013-11-22 13:37): Jimmy is usually the one who schedules crazy late dates :)
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 13:52): Wine bars brother
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 13:52): Shitty ones 
Nate (2013-11-22 14:06): Any ones in mind?
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:09): Lets have a small poll 
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:09): How long before your date do you confirm? 
Nate (2013-11-22 14:10): few hours usually
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:11): Like 2 hours 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:12): day of
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:14): Lol phil that was useful :) 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:15): haha
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:15) (1x <3): it doesn't matter really 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:15): in my humble opinion
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:15): Yup I was typing that
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:16): It doesn't matter just not less than 2 hours before I think
Marcus (2013-11-22 14:16): I like to play chicken,  see how long until the girl confirms 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:18): Marcus that's a good question you asked
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:18): I've played it a couple ways
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:19): Day before: "Hey cute girl, date with cute guy tomorrow at 7p.  Let's meet at xyz, see ya"
Nate (2013-11-22 14:20) (1x <3): 90% of the time I just do "See you at 8pm tonight" and they reply
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:20): or Day Of: A better plan is to send a text

message the day before that, on the outside, appears to be a neutral piece of information 

Example: “Hey, I’m going to be helping a buddy move tomorrow afternoon, so I might 

get to [Bar X] a few minutes after 7!”
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 14:20): KISS
Keep
It
Simple
Stupid
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:21) (2x <3): I text them at the time of the date and say "running late"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:22): Phil,  nice work
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:22): more succinct
Nate (2013-11-22 14:24): @jimmy know of any bad wine bars for the late night purpose?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 14:25): @Phillatio Me too
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:35): @Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 14:35): http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Wine+Bar+Murray+Hill&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY#attrs=RestaurantsPriceRange2.2
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 14:39): Nate I know of a bunch but all in my immediate vicinity
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 14:39): Most wine bars close at 2am fyi
Nate (2013-11-22 14:39): yeah
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 14:39): Oh yeah, I should set up a date for tonight
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:41) (1x <3): "Drinks. Tonight."
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 14:43): My latest thing to say to girls when they ask me how something is going is "Groin-grabbingly good" like Homer Simpson
Nate (2013-11-22 14:58): Question to closers.  What is the structure of the typical opening text you send to girls the day after you #close them?
Phillatio (2013-11-22 14:59) (1x <3): hey <name>, cool meeting you at <location>. <witty comment> -phil
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:00) (1x <3): I endorse this message
Mark (2013-11-22 15:00) (4x <3): I send that message with the brackets included
Mark (2013-11-22 15:02): God, I'm trying to bang this girl down here with braces
Mark (2013-11-22 15:03): Dental appliances make me rock hard
Mark (2013-11-22 15:04) (1x <3): Old school braces too, not that fancy invisalign shit they have in the states
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:04): you've got some issues there
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:04): I think you need some counseling
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 15:05): If you haven't received a BJ from a girl w/ braces...
Mark (2013-11-22 15:05): God made me this way
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:05): To help keep your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some

Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:24): Nice conversation, btw
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:24) (1x <3): I love the "You seem to be a very adventurous chick" part
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:25): Or rather, no "You seem to be an adventurous chick"
Mark (2013-11-22 15:27): Planting the seed

Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:28) (1x <3): cause I'm thinking I should move to chile

Nate (2013-11-22 15:29): well if they don't know your real name or real location, gonna be pretty hard to find you
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:29) (1x <3): Damn, I should get back in practice with my Spanish and join you on your next South American adventure
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:29) (1x <3): bastard in a basket
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:29) (2x <3): There is none of me in you.

Mark (2013-11-22 15:33) (2x <3): In my drunken haze i couldnt tell if her facial expressions indicated pain or pleasure
Mark (2013-11-22 15:34) (4x <3): Not that it makes a difference to me
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:34) (1x <3): I can't experience pleasure unless she's in pain
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:35): lol oh you
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:35): Don't sadism shame me, Phil!
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:36): whatever sinks your boat

Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:37): Maria at least cam all over her tits

Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:38) (1x <3): I might have to kill her 
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:38): No need to kill her, just kill the fetus
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 15:38): http://www.kyru.net/gallery/d/177-2/seinfeld.gif
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:38): A swift push down a flight of stairs ought to do the trick.
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:38): lol 
Mark (2013-11-22 15:38): I will let you borrow my trusty coat hanger
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:39): no need I got some old rusty hedge cutters around somewhere
Mark (2013-11-22 15:39) (1x <3): Once i clean off the blood
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:39): Rusty coat hanger, more like
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:39): Xander did you delete tinder
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:40) (1x <3): I know you didn't you devious sob 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:40): so go do that
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:40): No, because I'm still finishing screen shotting my last number closes. I'm not messaging or swiping anyone else, though
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:40): I'm almost done, just trying not to get fired while I screenshot
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:40): lol 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 15:41): Xander, whats the catalyst for getting rid of Tinder
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 15:41): other than u having already swiped through the pool of targetsd
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:42): oh they never run out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 15:42): i get that
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:42): Haha. I have already done what needs to be done. My text game is at about 95%, so I need to focus on other things like day game, because it's a psychological crutch
Mark (2013-11-22 15:42) (1x <3): New targets are born every minute
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 15:42): ok, cool stuff Xander
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 15:43) (2x <3): Fetus game

Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 15:43) (1x <3): When you're done w/ the coat hanger, can you leave me the dead baby
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:44): My day game is at like... 10%, if I'm being overly generous
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:44): Probably closer to 5%
Mark (2013-11-22 15:44): Is it still cold as fuck in ny
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:44): yes
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:44): colder than fuck
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:45): It was 50 this morning, so not too bad
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:45): It's actually 56 in Manhattan right now, look at that

Marcus (2013-11-22 15:54): Why r hot chick so stupid.  Its sad these chicks are going to raise stupider chicks. 
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 15:56): I believe that's known as "dysgenics"
Phillatio (2013-11-22 15:58) (1x <3): aka idiocracy 
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:00): As dysgenics concerns humans, some hypothesize that the percentage of low IQ people is increasing because they reproduce a lot more than high IQ people
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:00) (1x <3): aka why I'm going to spread my seed all over this world

Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:02): lmao
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:03): she looks hot
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:03) (1x <3): I'm basically a texting robot at this point
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:03): Oh, where should I take her, by the way
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:03) (1x <3): I would prefer somewhere extra cheap and not overly crowded by tards
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:04): It's this broad. Remember? ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/96dfb68035e70131a94422000ae848a8

Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:07): friday huh
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:07): idk keybar is my official date place
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:07): I don't know what that place would be like on a Friday, but probably decent?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:09): That's right, I don't give a shit about that rule: "Don't take girls on dates on weekends!"
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:09) (1x <3): As Tourette's Guy would say, "MY ASS"
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:10): lol yeah I mostly don't care either
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:12): Any other suggestions?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:12): Gents?
Nate (2013-11-22 16:12) (1x <3): I just got through asking the same question :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:13): Yes, but I wasn't paying attention then. I was too busy taking screenshots
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:14): okay guys 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:14): I'm gonna head to the airport
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:14) (1x <3): Oh goodie! 2 for 1 happy hour until 10pm 7 days a week at Keybar!
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:14): and sleep at my terminal
Nate (2013-11-22 16:14): Have fun Phil!
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:14): @Phillatio Have fun and good luck, my comrade
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:15): @Xander Xone yeah that's the point of Keybar 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 16:15): adios muchachos 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:25): Phil have fun, brohammed
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:25): i expect an uptick in Western Europe pregnancy rates in 3Q 2013
Mark (2013-11-22 16:26): Later phil
Mark (2013-11-22 16:27): Thats why i dont like fri/sat dates for the first few
Mark (2013-11-22 16:27): Inconsistent logistics due to the crowd
Mark (2013-11-22 16:27): Best bet is to go early
Marcus (2013-11-22 16:39): Date flaked.  Called it 
Nate (2013-11-22 16:39): what excuse?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:42): My date for tonight wants to meet tomorrow night instead because she's busy tonight. HOW DARE SHE
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:43): @Marcus By the way, I haven't received any intell on Brooklyn stuff going down this weekend
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:43): It might not be at all
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:43):  Translation: So you actually have no plan at all. Then we are still on for [insert night] at 9 pm. Pick you up there.
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:43): @Pippy She offered tomorrow night to hang out, so I think she's actually busy tonight but still wants to meet
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:44): Xander legit curious
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:44): how do u handle that via text.  Just want to know how you perceive the situ and respond 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:46): to expand, you want Friday....she wants Saturday.  You can be amenable to her schedule but then again, you are conceding to what's convenient for her'
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 16:46): or you could see it as taking the path of least resistance to her to come out and actually meet up
Marcus (2013-11-22 16:51): Hey sorry but I don't think ill be able to make it tonight, my boss just asked me to stay late and I don't know what time I'll get off :/
Marcus (2013-11-22 16:51): Sent lame. Com

Marcus (2013-11-22 16:52): thats Ezoo
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:53): @Pippy Decent looking girls from Tinder are already highly selective in the first place. The fact that she gave me her number is a testament both to her liking my look/humor from Tinder and running good text game
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:54): She offered tomorrow as a different date, indicating that she still wants to see me but probably had plans with her friends already for tonight
Marcus (2013-11-22 16:56): I guess I have time to cute my hair and shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:56) (1x <3): Anyway, you don't have to "out-alpha" her on every single little thing
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 16:58) (2x <3): I'm confident in myself. I don't even care if she flakes tomorrow, because I have options
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:00): lol, now she's just being playful
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:00): I sent "8 tomorrow" and she sent back "8:30 :)"
Nate (2013-11-22 17:01) (3x <3): "7:30 it is"
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:01): Haha
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 17:03): Thanks for taking the time to explain and expand
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 17:04): alrighty gents, going to GSC for an hour, have a merry fucking friday evening
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:12): I'm wondering if I should try to set up another date tonight. It's probably a little late for that
Nate (2013-11-22 17:12): they can always say no
D-money (2013-11-22 17:13): anyone want to go out tn?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:13): @Nate That's never stopped me before.
D-money (2013-11-22 17:13): #dateless in the city
Nate (2013-11-22 17:15): doing some day game after work for a couple hours
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:15) (1x <3): I'm getting my hair cut, and then I might be down for some day game
Nate (2013-11-22 17:16): gonna try to do that tomorrow
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:16): I'm certainly not doing NIGHT GAME
D-money (2013-11-22 17:16): i want to work out first
D-money (2013-11-22 17:16): no night game?
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:16): Not for me
D-money (2013-11-22 17:19): hm ok i dont think ill be free til like 9
Marcus (2013-11-22 17:19): Xander what is the place called
Marcus (2013-11-22 17:19): I'm going straight there
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:20): D & V Barbershop in Hoboken
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:20): Otherwise known as Dominick's and Vincent's Barber Shop
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:22): @D-money Perhaps "street game" is the more accurate name
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:24) (1x <3): @Nate I sent her "7:30 it is" she sends back "have fun waiting"
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:25): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiBPa6hp2Q

Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:33): I
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:33): *I'm actually thinking of sending her that "A little fight in ya... I like that"
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:33) (1x <3): But I'll probably just go with the tried and true: NO RESPONSE
Nate (2013-11-22 17:34): just dont show up till 830 :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:36): I won't
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:36): Every goddamn girl I meet out here is a fashion designer
Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:37): Or does biology research at NYU
Marcus (2013-11-22 17:44): New favorite song  ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/9421520035f50131420c22000aef140c

Xander Xone (2013-11-22 17:44): Hmm, still contemplating setting up a date for tonight
D-money (2013-11-22 17:45) (1x <3): ok im going to dinner, will ping later

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 19:06): Ideas regarding what?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 19:07): best bet is to not say anything else, reopen again in a day or two
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 19:07): You're doing okay, just one thing to keep in mind for next time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 19:07) (1x <3): When you said "Haha nevermind. see you tonight."  It almost seemed like you hesitated/doubted what you were saying
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-22 19:07): Kinda like if you open with a direct cocky/funny line at a bar.  The girl says "What??" and then caught off guard you change what you originally said or say "Oh, nothing"
Marcus (2013-11-22 19:42): Things go over her head. Didnt want to explain things . but 'nevermind' wasn't good and I agree
Marcus (2013-11-22 19:42): Anyways she texted again
Marcus (2013-11-22 19:42): I just got off....Well have to reschedule for another day
Jimmyayo (2013-11-22 20:24) (3x <3): Just had a chili cheese dog from 7-11. Feel so fat 
Phillatio (2013-11-22 21:13) (3x <3): Getting trashed at the airport is always fun

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-23 12:24): girls were nice, more open.  Younger too and a bit more "alt" than the neon-wearing sluts (God bless 'em) that you'll find at an Avicii show
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-23 12:24): i think Jimmy stumbled into and found a potentially untapped pool of poosy
Xander Xone (2013-11-23 15:20): I like the sound of that. Point me to the nearest poosy paradise

Xander Xone (2013-11-24 13:55): Hmm

Nate (2013-11-24 14:03): Can't send another cat pic to that chick :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 14:38) (1x <3): A lot of doubters of the efficacy of game insist that game is a charade 
that only works in the short term to fool women, and that women will 
eventually figure out the man doesn’t have “real” high status. Stories 
like this put the lie to that thinking. Game is its own status; the mere
 application of game is a demonstration of status, and not just a proxy 
for status.

Marcus (2013-11-24 15:32): My god its cold

Marcus (2013-11-24 17:16): Meh. Looking for an apartment is sooo fucking annoying 
Marcus (2013-11-24 17:23): This is my flake today : Hi Mark, won't be able to make it today, my aunt who had cancer passed away last night. Sorry. If you want to go grab something to eat wednesday night let me know.

  Public places suck for pickup. Cold approaches don't really work in today's society.

Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:07): I've been arguing with him now for like 15 mins
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:08): Now he's "giving me advice"
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:08): Since I'm a "beginner"
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:10): I'm going to start trolling him. "Okay, I see what you mean. You seem to know a bit more than me"
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:16): Younglove
Pros of social events: 1. They are fun 2. More single woman 3. More receptive woman 4. Less competition 5. Do activities you like with like minded individuals

Okay, I see what you mean
I'm pretty beginner

If you can DOMINATE your nitche they'll be chasing after you.

Mark (2013-11-24 18:27): Banged colombian chick last night and this afternoon
Mark (2013-11-24 18:28): Goodbye land of free flowing poosy
Mark (2013-11-24 18:28): Hello cold frigid hellhole
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:28): But Mark, day game doesn't work!
Mark (2013-11-24 18:29): Yeah best not to bother them
Mark (2013-11-24 18:29): That would be rude
Mark (2013-11-24 18:30): Invite me to the joizy chat
Mark (2013-11-24 18:30): I have time to kill
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:30): That Younglove/Fox guy sounds like a fucking retard
Mark (2013-11-24 18:31): When i left colombian girls apt earlier today, she asked if i was gonna call her from NY
Mark (2013-11-24 18:31) (1x <3): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:32) (2x <3): I didn't know Colombian girls had such a good sense of humor
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:35): I have to give up trying to have rational arguments with human beings
Mark (2013-11-24 18:37): I wanted to say "lol" in person
Mark (2013-11-24 18:38): But i am too kind
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:38): You have a gentle heart
Mark (2013-11-24 18:40): Until you put a gamecube controller in my hands
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:40): I think Younglove already picked up on the fact that I was trolling
Mark (2013-11-24 18:41): Contro just pm'd me
Mark (2013-11-24 18:41): And asked if we were trolling
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:42) (1x <3): He's more clever than I give him credit for.
Mark (2013-11-24 18:44): If you troll you have to committ to it full-time
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:44): Oh, you don't have to tell me, Mark
Mark (2013-11-24 18:44): I've learned that from the great master bloodninja
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:45): Aaaaaaaand I'm spent.
Mark (2013-11-24 18:46): Tag me in
TiMex (2013-11-24 18:47): Lol is he drunk or something
Mark (2013-11-24 18:52) (1x <3): No but i am
Mark (2013-11-24 18:52) (1x <3): Airport bar ftw
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:53): Younglove = Grade A Moron
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 18:58): I wanna save that entire convo
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 19:04): 
What a faggot... salsa dancing and zumba
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 19:08): lolololololol
TiMex (2013-11-24 19:17): I almost wish he was the one trolling
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-24 19:19): http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/43276597.jpg
Mark (2013-11-24 19:24): I'm going to miss my flight lol
Mark (2013-11-24 19:25): Man i came so close to bagging a chick on the plane during the last flight
Mark (2013-11-24 19:25): Need to get my inflight nut
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 19:27): Haha
Nate (2013-11-24 20:41): Conservative date 1, no kiss so far, but pretty fun. Another date at 930 :) 
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 20:54): Lol
Nate (2013-11-24 20:59) (1x <3): Shit its 9,have to end this one before the next, and I'm pretty drunk 
Nate (2013-11-24 20:59): Next date is gonna be interesting 
Nate (2013-11-24 21:56): Bitch is gonna be 30 mins late + 15 that I was late.  Glad I picked a bar close to my place
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:18): Nate has a drinking problem!
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:19): Jad

  

  

  
  

  you
 know what this thread is missing...... serious conversation. Its nice 
to be striking and sarcastic, but from time to time, Its nice to be 
reflective. I, for one, learned a shit load this weekend... and I want 
to share my learnings with your fine gentlemen 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-24 22:20): Met Jad on Friday @ concert Jimmy and I went too
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-24 22:20): seemed like a decent, focused dude.
Nate (2013-11-24 22:24): His fault for picking a time when I was drunk to want to be serious
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:26): I want to rescue him...
Nate (2013-11-24 22:27): like a puppy
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:27): I can't believe how much bullshit Younglove spewed today
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:28): It was like he had just come in from posting on puahate.com
Nate (2013-11-24 22:28): Jersey, proving once again when I don't like jersey
Xander Xone (2013-11-24 22:28) (1x <3): @Nate I just beat the 7th Gym today
Phillatio (2013-11-25 07:51): Just to see what it's like in Europe lolz
Phillatio (2013-11-25 07:51): I installed tinder
Phillatio (2013-11-25 07:51) (1x <3): Damn there's a lot of cute girls on there
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 09:52): Morning
Marcus (2013-11-25 10:08): Phil and how is that different than NYC
Nate (2013-11-25 10:28): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/2f3e8c70381401316f1222000ab38586
Nate (2013-11-25 10:29): Met this girl 2 weeks ago going to the moma before the meatup
Nate (2013-11-25 10:29): Tall, brunette.  8.5 or 9
Mark (2013-11-25 10:33) (2x <3): i'm back negroes
Nate (2013-11-25 10:34): Welcome back felon!
Mark (2013-11-25 10:34): how you holding up
Nate (2013-11-25 10:34): moving forward
Nate (2013-11-25 10:35): Trying to decide what I want to do with my life, and doing a lot of reading on game.
Nate (2013-11-25 10:36): Still way too many holes in my game.  Guessing it's gonna take years before I'm mpua.  
Nate (2013-11-25 10:36): Did have 2 dates in a row last night, although neither got me anywhere
Mark (2013-11-25 10:37) (1x <3): what do you think is your biggest hole
Nate (2013-11-25 10:37): Definitely my conversation skills, and balancing attraction and comfort
Nate (2013-11-25 10:38): I look at some of the conversation logs for krauser pua, and realize the difference in what I do
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:39): @Nate You should give up on daygame. Girls are just gonna think you're creepy, and they don't want to be bothered anyway
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:39): Public places are a waste of time.
Nate (2013-11-25 10:39): @Xander yeah you're right.  I'll never be able to do it.  Day game is a waste of time.  I should only go to meetups.
Mark (2013-11-25 10:40): xander i want to pet you with my penis
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:40): Mark was saying that Machine Learning and JavaScript meetups are really good for meeting chicks
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:40) (1x <3): I'm gonna check 'em out this week
Mark (2013-11-25 10:40): dont forget basket weaving and knitting
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:40): Haha
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:40): What an epic troll yesterday
Nate (2013-11-25 10:40): I like me some grandma action
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:41): That sorry sod has no idea
Nate (2013-11-25 10:41): I almost want to join the nj chat just to see the log...almost
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:41): I'll save the text for you
Mark (2013-11-25 10:42): we went airtight on younglove
Mark (2013-11-25 10:42): guys, im so dark right now i could be mistaken for a nagger
Nate (2013-11-25 10:42) (1x <3): I heard he was making ltd look driven
Mark (2013-11-25 10:43): cant wait to hit the streets again
Mark (2013-11-25 10:43): chile was awesome weather wise, but most of the hotties were off limits bc mi espanol es malo
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:46): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8DqluD7aD-A1EJkItAhIkehbh3app4e98XIlmLzIvY/edit?usp=sharing
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:47): lol, and three people immediately rush to click on the link
Mark (2013-11-25 10:48): goddamn lurkers
Mark (2013-11-25 10:49): xander did you pickup the gamecube
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:50): Nope.
Nate (2013-11-25 10:51): haha, just got to the trolling
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 10:52): Mark, welcome back brother!
Mark (2013-11-25 10:52): gracias
Nate (2013-11-25 10:53) (1x <3): yeah day game definitely doesn't work.  That's why I don't have my 3rd date in 2 days from it.
Nate (2013-11-25 10:54) (1x <3): "Daygame is all about memorizing cheesy lines and getting numbers that don't go anywhere."
Nate (2013-11-25 10:55): contro is really dumb
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:56): Yeah. He PMed Mark early on to ask if he was trolling, but I guess that Mark trolled him via PM as well
Mark (2013-11-25 10:56): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/1ec9c130381801316f1222000ab38586
Nate (2013-11-25 10:57): lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:57): trololololol
Mark (2013-11-25 10:57): not a bad way to pass 2 hrs waiting at the airport
Mark (2013-11-25 10:58): also forgot how awesome the airport bar is
Mark (2013-11-25 10:58): need to travel more
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 10:59): I want an airport mojito
Nate (2013-11-25 11:00): I want an airport bang
Nate (2013-11-25 11:00): airports rule for picking up girls though
Nate (2013-11-25 11:00): so many women with nothing to do but wait
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:00): I can imagine. They're all so disoriented, too
Mark (2013-11-25 11:01): i got a # at jfk
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:01): But they'll probably think I
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:01): am a creep...
Mark (2013-11-25 11:01): santiago airport is tiny though
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:01): Younglove must be like 18
Mark (2013-11-25 11:01): i got a # but it wasn't an efficient use of my time
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:02): @Mark Not as worthwhile as trolling
Mark (2013-11-25 11:03): did you daygame this past weekend 
Mark (2013-11-25 11:04): i expect you to be an approach machine by now
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:04): @Mark Not really. I was mostly fretting about having $10 in the bank and $10 on my Metrocard
Mark (2013-11-25 11:05): no worries
Mark (2013-11-25 11:05) (1x <3): well pound it this week
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:06) (1x <3): I was reminded again and again why I despise nightgame, however
Mark (2013-11-25 11:07): me 2]
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:07) (1x <3): Jacky
Have any of you guys actually used meet up. Com for hobby interests
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:07): lol, the disease is spreading
Mark (2013-11-25 11:07): heheeh
Nate (2013-11-25 11:07): I would say there's less competition for daygame, but these guys were never in the running
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 11:09): http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/11/25/your-daily-game-condensed/
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 11:09): @Xander
Nate (2013-11-25 11:09): reading krauser is very informative
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:10): Obviously there's less competition for daygame. When you go to a bar, practically every other guy there is competing with you in one form or another
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:10): Even if they're running passive aggressive game
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:11): It's like Mark was saying the other day. Girls get overstimulated from all of the options
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 11:12): cockptions
Nate (2013-11-25 11:19): I forgot to call that black model yesterday like I told her I would.  I'm gonna call her today.  I think this girl is gonna go nuts with my lack of giving a shit
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 11:20): It sometimes feels like this stupid little contest of who gives less shits
Nate (2013-11-25 11:20): yeah
Nate (2013-11-25 11:20): I ran into her on the street and her little head was spinning when I told her she should have called me if she liked me
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:21): Hear, hear
Nate (2013-11-25 11:23): There's the advantage here that I genuinely don't give a crap about her, except that she has a perfect 10 body
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:24): But Nate, there is no such thing as a perfect ten!
Nate (2013-11-25 11:25): Well she has one hell of a body.  She's about 6'2-6'3 with short heels on, big breasts on a thin hourglass body
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:26): Oh right. She's going to crush you to death with her thighs
Nate (2013-11-25 11:27): I'll take it
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:40): @Pippy Ah, now I remember why I had read all of these before. Because they're on the twitter
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 11:41): I'm sending this chhick the most boring vanilla texts
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 11:42): What am I doing lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 11:43) (1x <3): STOP TEXTING
Nate (2013-11-25 12:15): I just found a good reason to day game with a wing.  So we can video each other in set and analyze later
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 12:26): I try to take pics of my bros in set, but it can be tricky to do it and not get caught
Nate (2013-11-25 12:28): I'm looking at cameras someone can hold without appearing to record
Nate (2013-11-25 12:31): something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Mini-30fps-chewing-shaped-camera/dp/B004Y3PH20/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1385400673&sr=1-1&keywords=gum+camera
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 12:33): Dammit nate I'm the resident creep here
Nate (2013-11-25 12:33): lol
Nate (2013-11-25 12:33): I want to get good video of my approaches and conversations so they can be analyzed later to see what I need to do
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 12:37): Who's getting the button cam?

Nate (2013-11-25 12:37): me
Nate (2013-11-25 12:37): well stick cam
Mark (2013-11-25 12:38): what would be really cool is have an earpiece and have someone feed you lines
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 12:38): "That's a lovely lapel pin you have there" *leans in closer and sees camera lens focusing* "What the..."
Nate (2013-11-25 12:40): haha, in this case you would be creeping nearby with your hand suspiciously pointing toward me
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 12:44): http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/11/plan-b-morning-after-pill-weight-limit-pounds
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 12:44) (1x <3): Another reason not to fuck fatties
Nate (2013-11-25 14:10): I'm gonna start doing more of krauser's day game stuff to see if I can make it work
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:16) (1x <3): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8sgBV4EIfFeR2o3OXpBbXUwRWs/edit?usp=sharing
Nate (2013-11-25 14:18): Thanks man
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:20): No problemo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 14:25): Good looks Xander
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:28): Uuuugh, I just want the main chat to shutup
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:28): Perhaps it's time for me to leave again
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:41): Q: what is it about the main chat that bothers you guys so much?
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:42): All of the beta
Nate (2013-11-25 14:43): well schmitty isn't doing thaty
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:44): gay
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:45): He's one of the better ones around, I think he does some coaching too
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:45): Yeah, he does.
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:45): He has very little understanding of the underlying theory, though
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:45): Perhaps
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:46): I've gone out with him several times
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:46): But it's better to be taking tons of action while lacking theory, than the other way around 
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:46): That's certainly true
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:46): He seems to get pretty good results
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:47): His friends call him the "natural" of their group
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:47) (1x <3): Better to be a caveman than a troglodyte
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:47): Although being a tall blonde white guy, I think it would be hard not to be somewhat of a natural 
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:48): The girl that Marcus fingerblasted on the subway, Schmitty couldn't understand why she didn't want to make out with him
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:49): He had already fallen into her frame of being mere entertainment much earlier in the night
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 14:50): Did u tell him?
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:50): I don't remember, haha
Nate (2013-11-25 14:51): The guy at the subway gave me 'are you crazy' eyes when I asked for 4 lines of sriracha sauce.
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:51): @Nate If I had been there, I would have asked for 8.
Nate (2013-11-25 14:52):   Hence your need to run for the bathroom and scream every day
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 14:53): It's only the horror of existing that I'm screaming about
Mark (2013-11-25 15:39): Oh baby
Mark (2013-11-25 15:40): Just had a 6/7 shit
Mark (2013-11-25 15:41): On the richter scale
Nate (2013-11-25 15:41) (1x <3): Is that also on the Bono scale?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 15:41): Are you okay??
Nate (2013-11-25 15:42): one more point and he'd have two assholes
Mark (2013-11-25 15:42): Alright
Mark (2013-11-25 15:43): I'm gonna need to shower now
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 15:43): Time to install that bidet
Mark (2013-11-25 15:43): I already have a sink
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 15:43): Just get a rimjob
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 15:43): You need a hose like the Indians
Mark (2013-11-25 15:44): Who wants hot fudge?
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 15:44): *raises his hand*
Mark (2013-11-25 15:45): *puts raised hand into anus*
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 15:46): How has the rubber replica of my fist been working out for you?
Mark (2013-11-25 15:47): Good but its a bit thin
Mark (2013-11-25 15:48): Gonna need your thigh sooner or later
Mark (2013-11-25 15:50): I wish someone was here to record this melodic symphony of sounds my asshole is making
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 15:51): Would that I could harmonize with you from here
Nate (2013-11-25 16:12): Made a small mistake.  Called the model and let her get off too easy when she asked me if she could call back in 20 mins.  Assuming she does, definitely gonna tease her about it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 16:13): What would've been a better alternative?
Nate (2013-11-25 16:14): tease her that she's with a guy and that he'd be jealous knowing I was on the phone, then let her go
Nate (2013-11-25 16:14): which is what I'm gonna do when she calls
Mark (2013-11-25 16:15): is she with a guy or are you assuming it
Mark (2013-11-25 16:15): bc that frame is not favorable for you
Nate (2013-11-25 16:15): I'm assuming it, but considering how cagey she was about where she was at the time
Nate (2013-11-25 16:16): @Mark why?
Mark (2013-11-25 16:16): it puts her on a pedestal
Nate (2013-11-25 16:16): hmm, I thought it framed me as the one guys would be jealous of
Mark (2013-11-25 16:16): now there are 2 guys vying for her attention
Nate (2013-11-25 16:16): ahh
Nate (2013-11-25 16:17): okay I won't do that I guess 
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:17): He's right, you know
Nate (2013-11-25 16:17): I wonder if I should tell her I was on a date last night :)
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:18): No need to overtly state it
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:18): That come across as try-hard
Mark (2013-11-25 16:18): dont mention it unless she asks
Nate (2013-11-25 16:18): I wasn't planning to
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:18): "What were you up to last night?" "It's complicated."
Nate (2013-11-25 16:19): My mind is in krauser's world where he actively tells girls he's with other girls, and takes them all out together on the same date
Mark (2013-11-25 16:20): i like krauser but a lot of his stuff is too advanced for me
Mark (2013-11-25 16:20): i certainly cant pull it off without looking tryhard
Mark (2013-11-25 16:20): its tough thinking what kind of frame to use when/if she calls you back
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:20): Well, he's banging international top tier pussy on the reg, so that's understandable
Mark (2013-11-25 16:20): the fact that she ended the call gives her the upper hand
Mark (2013-11-25 16:21): the current frame is that she is busy and are you waiting around doing nothing
Mark (2013-11-25 16:21): whether or not thats true
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:22): If she calls back, just tell her that you're busy
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:22): Pull the same bs
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 16:22): Would a better end to that call be "actually 20 min from now I'll be in a mtg, I'll just call u another time"
Mark (2013-11-25 16:23): yeah that would be better
Mark (2013-11-25 16:23): you can just say 'ill call you back later tonight or tomorrow'
Mark (2013-11-25 16:23): i think if/when she calls back, just dont answer
Mark (2013-11-25 16:24): and text her 'im busy, will call you back later' w/e
Nate (2013-11-25 16:28): she doesn't have texting
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:29): What the...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 16:29) (1x <3): ......NEXT
Nate (2013-11-25 16:29): I just finished my phone call.  Actually went well.  We talked about happy endings, I made fun of her driving.  She said it was okay to call her again and I mocked that and told her to call me when she knows she's coming back
Nate (2013-11-25 16:30): Said I had to work and we'd talk again
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:30): Want to understand how the female mind looks? Check this out: http://www.rebellesociety.com/2013/05/06/6-sweet-survival-tips-for-super-sensitive-souls/
Nate (2013-11-25 16:31): The funny part of this chick is she cut the first date we had short, and the conversation was aweful, and at some point I got bored and just started kissing her randomly.  Somehow she's now more into me than before
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:32): Sounds good to me
Nate (2013-11-25 16:32): Probably because I just demonstrated I didn't give a shit
Nate (2013-11-25 16:33): Also on the call I told her I'm a good cook, and if she's very lucky she might taste it
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 16:34): "I'm a good cock, and if you're very lucky you might taste it"

"Shit I mean cook"
Nate (2013-11-25 16:34): haha
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 16:34): Text > Phone 
Nate (2013-11-25 16:34): Well we already talked about happy endings, so I didn't want to get too sexual on a phone call.  Just enough to demonstrate that I wasn't afraid of it
Nate (2013-11-25 16:35): She said she got rid of texting because her friends wouldn't stop texting her all the time and she got tired of it.  
Nate (2013-11-25 16:35): How much and which parts of that statement is truth I don't know
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:35): Doesn't it say something like "TEXT NOT DELIVERED" if you text someone who can't receive it?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 16:36): Is she nuts?  She sounds a little nuts
Nate (2013-11-25 16:36) (1x <3): @jimmy she's a model, so of course she's nuts
Mark (2013-11-25 16:37): every girl and her dog is a "model" in NY
Nate (2013-11-25 16:37): @Xander I never bothered trying to text her.  Every time I've called her she's picked up the phone, so I'm not gonna try
Nate (2013-11-25 16:38): I don't know yet what she models, but the casual nature of her flying back and forth to LA tells me she's a real model, that and how she looks
Mark (2013-11-25 16:39): i always ask what agency shes with, and if its not one of the major ones, then its irrelevant imo
Nate (2013-11-25 16:39): I'm not gonna bother asking until after I've fucked her.  I don't want to make it seem like I give a shit about it
Mark (2013-11-25 16:40): yeah nows not the time if you didnt already ask upon meeting
Nate (2013-11-25 16:40): I didn't even find out she modeled until the first date
Nate (2013-11-25 16:40): she was so dressed down when I first met her she was actually my practice approach
Mark (2013-11-25 16:41): same thing happened to me in usq before i left town
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:41): @Mark I don't even know what the major modelling agencies are
Mark (2013-11-25 16:41): russian girl was coming back from yoga and looked so plain i expected her to be a librarian
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:42): loooool
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:43): And here comes  Bob McHerpaDerp
Mark (2013-11-25 16:43): this guy
Mark (2013-11-25 16:44): basically, not all models are hot
Mark (2013-11-25 16:44): case in point
Mark (2013-11-25 16:44): http://i.models.com/rankings/hotlist/i/Tamara_400_Document.jpg
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:44) (1x <3): What a beautiful Elvish man
Nate (2013-11-25 16:44): eww
Mark (2013-11-25 16:45): thats hugo weaving in drag
Nate (2013-11-25 16:45): This girl has a smokin body, and a 7 face when not dressed up and an 8.5-9 face with makeup
Mark (2013-11-25 16:53): why are you people trying to help them
Nate (2013-11-25 16:53): I'm feeling charitable
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:53): Because I still have 5% of my humanity left
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 16:53): I plan on excising it this weekend, though.
Mark (2013-11-25 16:56) (1x <3): the power of christ compels you
Nate (2013-11-25 16:56): more like the power of antichrist
Mark (2013-11-25 17:13): Ugh
Mark (2013-11-25 17:14): Cant stop the diarrhea
Mark (2013-11-25 17:14): My asshole is raw
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:17): You're the one who decided to go to the 3rd world.
Mark (2013-11-25 17:22): yeah i shouldve never come to NY
Mark (2013-11-25 17:22): i eat 2 philly cheesesteaks and a breakfast bagel and my asshole cant stop vomiting 
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:25): Stop it, you're ASIAN, which means you're as lactose intolerant as I am
Nate (2013-11-25 17:25): I used to be lactose intolerant, but I got better
Mark (2013-11-25 17:25): not the lactose i swear
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:25): @Nate Did you go to sensitivity training classes?
Mark (2013-11-25 17:25): its the grease
Nate (2013-11-25 17:25): @Xander that was it
Mark (2013-11-25 17:26): i was eating proper meals in chile compared to this shit
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:26): @Mark Maybe something is wrong with your gallbladder
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 17:26): @Mark
Mark (2013-11-25 17:26): whatever my stomach better man the fuck up
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 17:26): what was your fave thing about Chile, compared to other places you've been to
Mark (2013-11-25 17:27): the beefsteak
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:45): God, these people are morons
Mark (2013-11-25 17:45): rsd circlejerk in progress
Nate (2013-11-25 17:45): It's because most of them look like pre-teens and think that's why they aren't getting laid
Nate (2013-11-25 17:57): gol ignored my blatant amog
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 17:57): Haha, yep
Nate (2013-11-25 18:27) (1x <3): okay 7 hours of reading krauser stuff and my mind is getting tired
Xander Xone (2013-11-25 18:30) (2x <3): I was wondering what was different about you that made me notice you out of all the girls, and I thought of it: ya dress weird
Marcus (2013-11-25 20:45): God its freezing
Jimmyayo (2013-11-25 20:46) (1x <3): Its not too bad but the wind is going through my chonies

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 21:29): childhood friend is throwing a party beforehand
Nate (2013-11-25 21:30): Jesus Fucking Christ.  I got through about half of this before I had to stop reading.  My member is tired enough as it is: http://krauserpua.com/2011/02/19/text-sex-chat-101-button-nose/
Nate (2013-11-25 21:30): Don't read this unless you're alone or with a girl naked
Nate (2013-11-25 21:40): Reading Krauser is a serious eye opener
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 21:40): how so
Nate (2013-11-25 21:41) (1x <3): The mentality, the examples of good conversation, the responses to shit tests, the mindset, the failures and the learning experiences, I could go one, but you get the idea
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 21:42): thanks for sharing
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-25 21:42): it's impressive to see his progression from the 2009 posts until now
Nate (2013-11-25 21:43): I'm in early 2011.  Educational

Nate (2013-11-25 21:44): I could have read much more, but I'm really reading it
Nate (2013-11-25 21:45): In a way it's taught me much more about what I don't know than what I do
Nate (2013-11-25 21:45): In a way that's more valuable
Nate (2013-11-25 21:45): Actually in every way
D-money (2013-11-25 22:42): Yo pippy you'll be in Frederick?

D-money (2013-11-26 00:23): How do you find out if a girl has a bf via text
D-money (2013-11-26 00:23): Before going on date?
D-money (2013-11-26 00:24): I don't want to waste my time/ want to get a feel for the tone
D-money (2013-11-26 00:24): We're supposed to meet on Friday

D-money (2013-11-26 00:28): Just talked here and there
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 00:28): Btw out of curiosity, do u have a bf?
D-money (2013-11-26 00:29): Lolol wouldn't that make it high pressure if she doesn't, once we hang out?
D-money (2013-11-26 00:29): Maybe I'll try, "who do you hang out with these days?"
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 00:30): Its ok to have a little pressure/tension, that's how dates are at first 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 00:31): I dunno man, seems so high school ish
D-money (2013-11-26 00:35): Ha yeah a bit. I want to keep her guessing/chasing a little bit first
D-money (2013-11-26 00:37): Yesterday I asked her to pick a place for Friday and today she sends me this detailed list of four places with descriptions.. I was justthinking, whichever one is closest to your place! Lol

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 08:58): @D-money...avoid doing that next time.  rarely has it worked out well when i left it a girl to choose...i'm talking maybe once in a blue moon if she knew me well and planned an activity then maybe
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 08:58): otherwise, take the lead, take the reigns and plan the night out like a baus.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 09:51): Back from meeting but to further expand on that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 09:52): Setting the plans/logistics helps stack the cards in your favor and is a more attractive display of behavior than putting it on the girl and leaving the seduction up to chance
Nate (2013-11-26 10:13): @phil how did it work out with the girl your visiting?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 10:35): Shitcakes

Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 16:46): Sandeep
W/e she thinks
I was just thinking how my cousins and I have a FB chat and their always talkin bout their random college life and I have nothing to contribute that they'd be interested in. They used to all adore me, now ignore me unless they need career advice.
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 16:47): Sandeep
with 2 of my best friends. I talk to them bout my progress with women, thats fun. Then to reciprocate, I ask them how they're doing in their life, and then theres just... nothing.

Sandeep
Dunno how to make new friends besides joining a new activity -- like alot of friends made here
Nate (2013-11-26 16:47): He honestly sounds like a little girl there :(

D-money (2013-11-26 22:10): Then she said "with wine in hand"
D-money (2013-11-26 22:10): @nate really? I took it as Kind of standoffish
D-money (2013-11-26 22:11): Like maybe build more comfort
D-money (2013-11-26 22:11): No?
Nate (2013-11-26 22:13): Everything this girl has said has been trying to get you to talk dirty
D-money (2013-11-26 22:14): I.. Am I missing something?
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 22:16): D this is the same chixk?
D-money (2013-11-26 22:17): For Friday yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 22:17): From ur screen shot
D-money (2013-11-26 22:17): No no
D-money (2013-11-26 22:17): Diff
D-money (2013-11-26 22:17): That one was a bit more obvious lol
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 22:17): Well that was confusing but think I getchu
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 22:17): So ur question isabout which one?
D-money (2013-11-26 22:18): Oh I see
D-money (2013-11-26 22:18): The second one..
D-money (2013-11-26 22:18): Non screen shot
D-money (2013-11-26 22:19): This actually ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/aefb550039400131877022000aba07be
Jimmyayo (2013-11-26 22:23): Ur bad at cropping text screenshots stop cutting shit off the ends
D-money (2013-11-26 22:24): Lol sorry I just try to crop the name out
D-money (2013-11-26 22:24): She said "I chose my couch for the look"
D-money (2013-11-26 22:24): Me: how do you look on it?
D-money (2013-11-26 22:25): Her: you could find out
D-money (2013-11-26 22:25): What to say now?
D-money (2013-11-26 22:30): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/298f401039420131467622000a2d0c5a
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:50): I
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:50): *Frankly, I'm amazed that these girls are still texting you
Mark (2013-11-26 22:51) (1x <3): who let you out of your cage
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:52): Now time for me is nothin' cause I'm countin' no age
Mark (2013-11-26 22:52) (2x <3): its possible hes doing their math homework
D-money (2013-11-26 22:52): Lol @xander why?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:52): You aren't really leading the conversations at all
D-money (2013-11-26 22:53): What do you mean?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:53): You keep phrasing things in question form rather than statement form
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:53) (1x <3): That generally comes across as more supplicating
D-money (2013-11-26 22:53): Ah
D-money (2013-11-26 22:54): So.. Give me an example of question vs statement
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:54): Even saying something like "I might like what I see" instead of "And what if I like what I see?" = infinitely better
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:55) (1x <3): You're basically framing the interaction in a way where you keep asking her questions and then wait to react to whatever she says rather than forcing her to react to what you're saying
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:55): And that is bad
D-money (2013-11-26 22:55): Ooh
D-money (2013-11-26 22:56): I then is "I want to see you tn"
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:56): Still too beta
D-money (2013-11-26 22:56): That's more direct?
D-money (2013-11-26 22:56): Wtff
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:56): It's more direct
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:56): But something better would be just sending her a line like "Drinks. Tonight. 8pm"
D-money (2013-11-26 22:57): Well.. I'm on a bus that arrives at 2am
D-money (2013-11-26 22:57): "Pick me up from the bus stop"
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:58) (1x <3): Don't be a literalist. I'm not talking about tonight in particular, but rather a general way of interacting with females
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:58): It could just as easily be "Drinks. Saturday. 8pm"
D-money (2013-11-26 22:59): What if they're busy Saturday, it's like shooting in the dark
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 22:59): David...
D-money (2013-11-26 23:00): Yes?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:00): I'm going to write a quote from @shitmydadsays
D-money (2013-11-26 23:00): Ok
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:02) (1x <3): "Out of your league? Son. Let women figure out why they won't screw you, don't do it for them."
D-money (2013-11-26 23:02): I don't see how this relates?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:03): Who cares if she's busy on Saturday? Let her tell you that.
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:04): You should be telling her where you two are going to meet. It's like you're practically commanding her
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:04): "Drinks. Saturday. 8pm"
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:05): "I'm sorry, but I can't that night. Another night?"
Nate (2013-11-26 23:05): @D-Money if they're busy they'll tell you, duh
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:05): Then you can say "Drinks. Tuesday. 9pm" or something like that
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:05): Either way, you're leading the interaction
D-money (2013-11-26 23:06): But what if it goes back and forth a few times, wouldn't it just be easier if I ask her when she's free?
D-money (2013-11-26 23:06): I can see how that's sort of letting her take command though
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:07) (1x <3): You're afraid of her turning you down, which is why you're being careful and asking her safe things like "What are you up to on Saturday?"
D-money (2013-11-26 23:07): Ugh maybe I've been doing all this subconsciously
Nate (2013-11-26 23:07) (1x <3): Because you're giving her the choices of times, not the choice to pick from yours
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:07): @Nate Exactly.
D-money (2013-11-26 23:07): Hmmm
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:07): However, playing it safe is exactly the sort of thing that kills attraction
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:07): Beta is safe. Alpha is dangerous and fun
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:08): Xander....reading shit like this man, you could prob solve world hunger if you wanted to
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:08): i know this aint advanced or whatever but shit, you come across as one smart info when u break it down the way you do
D-money (2013-11-26 23:08): Lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:08): good insight from Nate as well +1
Nate (2013-11-26 23:08): I had good teachers
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:08): *smart mofo
D-money (2013-11-26 23:08): But when I am too bold and stuff.. That sometimes turns of ppl too no?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:09) (1x <3): Yes, but you're going to have to learn to accept that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:09): D-money look at this as a pendulum man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:09): mauybe throughout most of like u were too much on the "beta" side and that didnt turn out well
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:09): It's far better to polarize people than to try to please everyone
Nate (2013-11-26 23:09) (1x <3): @D-Money it's always better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission.  Nothing in life is accomplished without risk
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:09): maybe for a while you'll be too much on the "alpha" side and that won't be efficient
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:09): you'll find your center man but let the pendulum swing both ways to see what works for YOU
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:09) (1x <3): Betas are afraid of not being liked, so they try to please everybody and end up forgetting about their own needs
Nate (2013-11-26 23:10) (1x <3): You cannot know what the line is until you cross it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:10): goodnight fellas
D-money (2013-11-26 23:10): Night
D-money (2013-11-26 23:10): Thanks for the input
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:10): http://31.media.tumblr.com/8cb046e6f16e05f8521e15de31927f52/tumblr_mt80mvKYGn1rqfhi2o1_500.gif
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:10): @Nate, @Xander
D-money (2013-11-26 23:10): Well.. I think I scared the girl off
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:10) (1x <3): @D-Money No problem. We'll cure this illness of yours in due time
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:11) (1x <3): Also, if you can't think of something good to text, just don't text anything
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:11): Xander i gotta sleep man i cant upvote ur shit all night
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-26 23:11): l8r
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:11): Silence builds tension and intrigue
D-money (2013-11-26 23:11): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/f07065d039470131876f22000aba07be
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:11): @Pippy Night
Nate (2013-11-26 23:12): Eesh
D-money (2013-11-26 23:12): After that flirty banter,
D-money (2013-11-26 23:12): Well, she's building a lot of intrigue now lol
Nate (2013-11-26 23:12): @D-Money, take a look at her lines.  Now imagine they were your lines, and you'd see what you should have said
D-money (2013-11-26 23:13): @nate what?? Lol that was confusing
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:13): @D-Money You've put her into the dominant position in this interaction, so she's essentially behaving like an alpha
Nate (2013-11-26 23:13): Flip the two ppl in that conversation
D-money (2013-11-26 23:13): Fuck, how to alpha?
Nate (2013-11-26 23:15): @D-Money go read krauserpua.com  start with the oldest first.  Read all of it.  There is a lot.  
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:19): @D-Money Also, relax. There are millions of attractive women out there. It's okay if you lose some
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:19): You want her to be qualifying herself to you, not the other way around
Nate (2013-11-26 23:19): Also trying hard not to lose a girl is a sure fire way to do just that
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:20): What does this girl have to offer to you? What makes her worthy of the D-Money golden cock?
Mark (2013-11-26 23:20): date more women
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:20): Spin multiple plates
D-money (2013-11-26 23:20): She's an old acquaintance!
Mark (2013-11-26 23:20): you cant fake abundance 
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:20): You can fake confidence, though
Mark (2013-11-26 23:21): some can, some cant
Mark (2013-11-26 23:21): this is the latter case
D-money (2013-11-26 23:21): Like we've always been slightly attracted to ech other
Mark (2013-11-26 23:21): so the solution is to just obtain what youre missing
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:22): I mean, I have practically nothing going for me in terms of society-determined status and wealth at the moment, but I know deep down that I'm an awesome motherfucker
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:22): Women are attracted to confidence, perhaps the more delusional the better
D-money (2013-11-26 23:26): So I project that subconsciously somehow in these beta-type texts?
Nate (2013-11-26 23:26): Doesn't look at that subconscious
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:27): You're projecting insecurity
D-money (2013-11-26 23:29): Shoot
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:31): D-Money, have you ever had a girl who was into you who you didn't like because you thought that you were out of her league?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:32): Or perhaps you didn't even think it. You KNEW that you were hotter than her
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:33): Treat the girls you actually like the same way, and their legs will open for you faster than you can say "WE GON FUCK OR WUT"
D-money (2013-11-26 23:34): Lol
D-money (2013-11-26 23:34): A lot of it is like.. Subconscious I think. I need to be more deliberate about these things
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:36): Girl you like texts you. Now, normally you would be tempted to text her right back as soon as you had the chance
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:37): Fight that instinct. Do what you would do if she were more of a nuisance than anything else
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:38): Ignore texts, take way longer than you should to reply back to texts, be dismissive, be edgy (you don't care what she thinks because you aren't trying to impress her)
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:38): Write way less than she does
D-money (2013-11-26 23:39): At what point in a relationship does this not apply anymore?
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:39): Never.
Nate (2013-11-26 23:39): When you're dead
D-money (2013-11-26 23:39): A few months?
D-money (2013-11-26 23:39): What? Lol
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:39): That's why it's called the red pill. The games never end, my friend.
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:39): Wake up and smell the shit.
Nate (2013-11-26 23:40): If you want a valuable girl, she's going to expect the guy she met to be the guy she keeps.  When you become someone else, she won't want you anymore, because you won't be the guy she met
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:40): Why do you think the divorce rate is so high? Guys get comfortable in relationships and act more beta. Girls lose attraction and seek excitement elsewhere
D-money (2013-11-26 23:41): That can't be the prevailing reason
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:43): With women entering the workforce and becoming financially independent, as well as the creation of female birth control, women have been liberated from certain forces that constrained them before
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:43): Therefore, the sexual marketplace has started to resemble a free market
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:44): Which means that many women will follow their hypergamous instincts and aim for the top 10% of the male population, the cream of the crop, the alphas
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:44): Because of this, it's a great time to be an alpha male, and a horrible time to be any other kind of male
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:45): Feminism has inadvertently recreated harems
D-money (2013-11-26 23:45): I remember reading something like that in the red pill though: love is never unconditional, you can't ever let your guard down
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:46): Therefore, when a woman doesn't have to stay with you because of financial reasons even though she doesn't love you, she is more likely to go "eat, pray, love"
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:47): And she's not going to love you if you ever stop taking the lead.
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:49) (1x <3): https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/52952a18-f6ac-407f-9453-121d0a004b21/image.png
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:51): It takes a while for this shit to sink in. You're not going to become alpha over night
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:51): But it will have to be a conscious endeavor until it becomes part of your personality
Nate (2013-11-26 23:52): Nothing truly worthwhile is ever easy
Nate (2013-11-26 23:52): Becoming an expert at something takes 10,000 hours of practice.  
D-money (2013-11-26 23:52): Ughh
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:52): That applies more to outer game, though
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:53): You can change yourself into an alpha within a year, if you work hard
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:53): I mean, YOU in particular. It would take others way longer
Mark (2013-11-26 23:54) (1x <3): i give up, this shit takes way too much effort
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:54): @Mark It's okay, we need betas and omegas. Who else am I going to step on to reach the highest heights of poosy paradise?
D-money (2013-11-26 23:54): Yes I need that. I need to morph into this alpha you speak of
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:55): You're the only one who can transform yourself. Even if someone else could magically make you alpha, that action would be beta in and of itself.
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:55): Since being alpha is about taking control of your own destiny.
D-money (2013-11-26 23:58): I'm going to be more aware of this now, set the symbol as the wallpaper on my phone
D-money (2013-11-26 23:58): Before it was a beta symbol
D-money (2013-11-26 23:58): That didn't work so well
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:59): If you're ever stuck, just think "What Would Clint Eastwood Do?"
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:59): Or James Bond, or whoever
Xander Xone (2013-11-26 23:59): Tyler Durden
Nate (2013-11-26 23:59): James Dean
Nate (2013-11-27 00:00): but not James Deen
Mark (2013-11-27 00:47): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/4e44e7d0395501316f1222000ab38586
Mark (2013-11-27 00:48): played around with tinder while in santiago
Mark (2013-11-27 00:49): was too busy bedding locals to focus on this one
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 01:02): Oh man. She wanted your D bad
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:50): Yo

Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:56): Nah she didn't..
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:56): I hardcore danced and kissed with  her friend right in front of her
Nate (2013-11-27 09:57): She get jealous?
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:58): Idk maybe
Jimmyayo (2013-11-27 09:58) (2x <3): Stahp Drinking So Much
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:58): But she wouldn't kiss me when we were alone at her apartment
Nate (2013-11-27 09:59): probably should have tried to kiss her before making out with her friend
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:59): lol maybe
Phillatio (2013-11-27 09:59): We were pretty handsy
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:00): Her bf showed up too
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:00) (2x <3): Ugly fuck. All her friends said I had pretty eyes lol nobody has brown eyes there

Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:03): It's hard gaming alone here in Amsterdam
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:03): I haven't done much
Nate (2013-11-27 10:03): you can do it!
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:04): Haha I know. Honestly I think American girls are easier
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:04): Also the chicks in NY are way prettier
Nate (2013-11-27 10:04): try harder then :)
Nate (2013-11-27 10:05): really?
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:05): Oh yea
Nate (2013-11-27 10:05): I remember the dutch chicks in curacao being hot
Nate (2013-11-27 10:05): maybe they all fled to warmer climates
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:06): Everyone here is a foreigner
Phillatio (2013-11-27 10:06): Tons of Aussies and Brits and some Americans

The concept of "different game for different types of girls" is bullshit. There is one type - me. A girl fits herself to me, not me to her.

Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:41): I'm used to the Marin County system in California, which has everything
Nate (2013-11-27 14:42): *cough* jersey city
Nate (2013-11-27 14:43) (2x <3): I can't believe McDonald's doesn't serve Cabernet.  I'm used to Nobu which has everything
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:43): It's fucking terrible. This whole country is illiterate
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:44): I used to hang out at those nice libraries a lot. Didn't hurt that my mom is a librarian as well
Nate (2013-11-27 14:45): brainy families rule

Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:48): It's generally a waste of time to get an advanced degree these days
Nate (2013-11-27 14:48): I know

Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:54): I've kinda been lagging on the whole finding a place to live thing, so I might be homeless for a while

Nate (2013-11-27 14:57): or find some chick to shack up with
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 14:58) (1x <3): Ah yes, returning to my parasitic roots.
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 15:03): Past girlfriends have probably spent a combined total of $100,000 on me
Nate (2013-11-27 15:03): I so want to have that skill
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 15:04): Just make them disgustingly dependent on you
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 15:04): I could have done the same thing with Emily
Nate (2013-11-27 15:07): I don't know how to do that
Xander Xone (2013-11-27 15:07) (1x <3): It's because you aren't as evil as me

Xander Xone (2013-11-29 11:33): That's for fags
Nate (2013-11-29 11:34): There's a clothing optional pool party, but that's for couples and women

Nate (2013-11-29 12:19): Well maybe I'll bribe Mark to help me

Xander Xone (2013-11-29 12:34): If this leads to a bang...

Nate (2013-11-29 12:35): yeah pretty much
Xander Xone (2013-11-29 12:48): I can't stop filling GayLife with garbage

Xander Xone (2013-11-29 13:28): We're going to a new dark side
Xander Xone (2013-11-29 13:29) (1x <3): The Closers are hitting every singles meetup in the NYC area!
Nate (2013-11-29 13:41) (1x <3): I number closed a chick on the subway to my parents last night.  I think I'll send "It was a pleasure meeting you while we were on our way to get stuffed"
D-money (2013-11-29 13:42): sounds reasonable

D-money (2013-11-29 13:44): getting stuffed with dick

Jimmyayo (2013-11-29 17:53): I met K for the first time last wed
Jimmyayo (2013-11-29 17:54) (2x <3): Hes annoying, like a nonstop brown mosquito clown thing 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-29 17:55) (2x <3): I think he mentioned something about Koreans eating dogs literally at least 8 times 
Xander Xone (2013-11-29 18:17): Heh heh heh heh heh heh
Marcus (2013-11-29 18:56): ... Yeah K is 'no fun'
Nate (2013-11-29 19:41) (2x <3): He was asking me out.  Hmm, guess there's no way I'm doing that
Xander Xone (2013-11-29 19:50): He sucks
Nate (2013-11-29 19:50): No thanks then
Nate (2013-11-29 19:50): Maybe if he was a really cool guy to hang with, but it sounds like he's another nilay
Xander Xone (2013-11-29 19:58): Way less creepy, but still awkward
Nate (2013-11-29 20:00) (1x <3): *yawn* stupid date is super late.  Glad I picked a place within wifi distance of my apartment

Jimmyayo (2013-11-29 21:50): K has way too high energy in a dancing monkey way
Jimmyayo (2013-11-29 21:51): But he paid for the cab and a round of drinks so not all bad
Marcus (2013-11-29 22:22): http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/archive/index.php/t-187990.html

Nate (2013-11-30 17:17): This is that bitchy russian I met who was drunk
Nate (2013-11-30 17:17): I'm guessing the proper move her to tell her to get her ass down here
Nate (2013-11-30 17:18): "Perfect, this is the east side too.  You're a 10 minute subway or 5 minute cab ride away"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:45): NAte dawg I don't think that's the pro move
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:45): Try meeting at La biblioteca on 40th and 3rd
Nate (2013-11-30 18:46): This is a hard nosed russian.  I feel like if I show any weakness she's gonna flake
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:46) (1x <3): Even if she thinks you're high value, a 10 block walk versus a 25 one could help. Just push it towards your goal: to meet up
Nate (2013-11-30 18:46): Also I don't give a shit enough to travel for her :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:46) (1x <3): Yeah man I feel u. In ur shows it might seem like u lose If u give her and inch
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:46) (1x <3): Your POV is understandable. I'm saying, take a step back and find the path of least reisistance
Nate (2013-11-30 18:47): Last time I tried to accomidate her she flaked without even sending a msg
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-11-30 18:47): Lol ok understood. I don't think you're wrong just offering a different angle here
Nate (2013-11-30 18:47): cool
Nate (2013-11-30 18:49): well too late anyway.  I sent the msg before this conversation began, except I said 'great' instead and removed half the words so the english was horrible
Nate (2013-11-30 18:55): The other russian is totally on the hook, and made some very soft references to fucking me the first night 'having enough time to fully get to know me'
Nate (2013-11-30 19:59): I was gonna go meet jimmy in brooklyn, but he's not replying.  Don't feel like going all the way out there by myself in case it's lame.
Nate (2013-11-30 20:47): :(
Marcus (2013-11-30 21:51): If he isn't replying it's not lame
Marcus (2013-11-30 21:52): It means -  he is slam drunk or he is Fucking a hot hipster
Nate (2013-11-30 21:57): at 8pm?  I hope so
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 22:49): I couldn't shake this mexican girl tonight brochacho 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 22:50): I have a cute friend hanging out there right now
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 22:50): Shes so mad at me right now for flaking
Nate (2013-11-30 22:57): No problem :)
Nate (2013-11-30 23:04): I assumed it would take something like that to keep you from texting
Nate (2013-11-30 23:06): Damn, Paul Walker is dead.  Life is short
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 23:26): God this chick is wayyy too easily impressed. 
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 23:27): I picked up some crappy thai food for dinner she said it was one of the best meals of her life
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 23:28): But goddam she is wild in bed. She wants me to slap her ass and face, lick her toes, she likes to lick my toes, taste her own pussy juice
Jimmyayo (2013-11-30 23:29) (1x <3): Shes good for only one thing: making an army of jimmy juniors
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 00:56): o paraphrase Tyler: PUAs encourage going out because we know the field fixes you. If you dress like shit the bouncer won’t let you in so you’re forced to look at the scene and learn a bit about fashion and social awareness. If you stutter, girls walk away, and you learn to start snuffing out the stuttering and sound more confident. If you’re quiet, girls will walk away when they can’t hear you over the music so you learn to make your voice carry.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 00:58):  When you’re too shy to touch a girl she loses interest so you learn to kino properly. When you fuck a chick and you’re out of breath in 30 seconds because you’re a fat fuck you learn to work out and be healthier so you can enjoy sex more.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 00:59): And down the road when you have some relationships, if you haven’t internalized alpha traits and become alpha you’ll lose girlfriends because they’ll see the incongruence/faking so you learn to internalize traits. You’ll lose girlfriends because you’ll play too many games and learn that there are points where you can tone down all the game playing. You’ll lose girlfriends because you looked at them as sex objects instead of people and learn to
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 00:59): build comfort and get to know and love them as human beings. You’ll lose social circles because you shat where you eat and had no self control and fucked a buddy’s girlfriend and you’ll learn to control your impulses and create your own set of rules you live by. You’ll lose buddies because you got into fights over girls and you’ll learn to chill out and not look at guys as competion especially your friends. You’ll realize you have a bunch of
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 01:00): shallow relationships because the guys only know you as a “bar buddy” and not a real friend and you’ll learn to make an effort to see them outside of the bars and develop real friendships
Jimmyayo (2013-12-01 01:00) (2x <3): -YaReally, on the importance of always putting yourself out in the field 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-01 01:44): Beautiful.

Nate (2013-12-01 17:07) (1x <3): He stirs
Nate (2013-12-01 17:31): God I can't touch anything today without getting an electric shock
Xander Xone (2013-12-01 18:09): @Nate Stop jerking off with a fleece rag
Nate (2013-12-01 18:10): You can't make me
Nate (2013-12-01 19:42): It's rather funny.  The harder this gets for me the more driven I feel.
Nate (2013-12-01 21:04): I have so much respect for sandeep now
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-01 21:19): Whys that

Phillatio (2013-12-02 10:59): um then I spent the rest of the time in bed with marcelle in paris
Nate (2013-12-02 10:59): Did you spend the whole paris part in bed, or get some fun other shit in too?
Nate (2013-12-02 11:00): Losing the passport sucks balls.  I had that happen too
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:00): yeah it cost me a good 100 euros 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:01): yeah we did some cool stuff in paris too. got to see the catacombs all the major sites notre dame

Nate (2013-12-02 11:01): nice nice
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:01): she took me to some really off the beaten trail resturants
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:02) (1x <3): the food is really good there and we got way bigger portions then I would have imagined 
Nate (2013-12-02 11:02): yeah I thought the french ate smaller portions
Marcus (2013-12-02 11:04): Shit phil.. sounds amazing
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:04): yeah I did too 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:04): but I never finished a meal
Nate (2013-12-02 11:10): Ugh I realized I never replaced my passport, so if I want to go out of country next month it would cost me like 2-300 bucks just for the passport
Nate (2013-12-02 11:10): maybe I should just travel somewhere within the US and order my passport
Nate (2013-12-02 11:10): normall
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:12): ah yeah
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:12): I have to replace it in 3 months
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:13): its free if I get to it
Nate (2013-12-02 11:13): yeah I forgot to do so
Nate (2013-12-02 11:13): cause I'm a moron
Nate (2013-12-02 11:14): Could go to St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, the Florida Keys
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:18) (1x <3): so does taking two really hot dutch taken blonds to a club like phd sound like a good idea 
Nate (2013-12-02 11:18): context?
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:18): well nicole and her 'lesbian' friend who both have bf/gf's are coming next week 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:18): and they want to go out clubbing
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:19): with moi
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:19): I figure I can convince one of them/both to hook up with me or use them as a jumping off point for other chicks
Nate (2013-12-02 11:20): Do whichever you want, both would work
Nate (2013-12-02 11:20): They would be good social proof
Nate (2013-12-02 11:20): I assume 'lesbian' is in quotes because she's bisexual
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:20): the lesbian friend likes me
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:20): she kept hitting on me 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 11:21): said I had big doe eyes

Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:21): common' 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:21): it shouldn't matter 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:21): 5 days that's nothing
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 18:23): I get really rusty, really fast haha
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:26): hm 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:27): I'm trying to think of a good suggestion from music. When I can't practice all the time I buzz on my mouth piece. 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:28): there's no real small form of day game 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:28): I guess
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 18:28): Sometimes I hate my job because there's so little human interaction
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:28): yeah I feel the same way sometimes
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:28): although I'm a bit introverted so I like the alone time
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 18:30): I enjoy coding/programming, but when I need to 'turn it on' after work for daygame, it takes a while for me to get in that social/talkative zone
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:30): gotcha
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:30): yeah I don't really feel that way 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 18:30): U don't seem introverted 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:30): well I'm more extroverted 
Phillatio (2013-12-02 18:30): than intro

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:16): yes yes D-Money
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:16): Just got back from daygaming @ GSC with Bro-J
D-money (2013-12-02 21:16): girl asked me how many people ive slept with
D-money (2013-12-02 21:16): oh cool
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:16): and he is off to meet Jad and some new Gothamite
D-money (2013-12-02 21:16): howd that go?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:16): @D-Money
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:16): what was your respond
D-money (2013-12-02 21:17): i joked it off at first "lost count after 300 blah blah"
D-money (2013-12-02 21:17): but now shes direct
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:17): my go to is a cocky-funny......"I stopped counting after 1,000. hbu?"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:17): lol dude
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:17): post a screenshot
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:17): lets get some context
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:18): i may not have the best answer.  I think if she kept pressing I'd just try to be like "Hey yeah I don't really like to talk about specific numbers I think it's kinda weird and skeevy"
D-money (2013-12-02 21:18): she says if i don't give her an answer within an hour we're not friends!
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:18): can u post a screenshot
D-money (2013-12-02 21:18) (1x <3): this girl is kind of strange, we hooked up over the wknd, then afterwards she tells me hey i dont want a boyfriend, but we can be fwb
D-money (2013-12-02 21:18) (1x <3): yeah
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:18): u can white-out her number or whatever
D-money (2013-12-02 21:19): i dont know how
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:19) (1x <3): yeah, I would channel your inner Xander here.  
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:19): what kind of phone do u have d-money?
D-money (2013-12-02 21:19): the i kind
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:19): Btw, I don't like how this girl is trying to hold a gun to ur head and she is using her pussy as leverage
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:19): what's an i kind?
D-money (2013-12-02 21:20): iphone
D-money (2013-12-02 21:20): hehe
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:20): ok, press the circle "Home" button and the button that is the top right of your phone AT THE SAME TIME
D-money (2013-12-02 21:20): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/661ef8a03def01316e8f22000a638017
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:20): oh yeah, she's not being serious with that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:21): she is bluffing hardcore i can already see it
D-money (2013-12-02 21:21): i want to say, "you know now i can't tell you right?":
D-money (2013-12-02 21:21): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/8a6ad7503def01316e8f22000a638017
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:21): Xander might say don't play to her frame.  You could ignore that outright and be totally fine.  She's totally more invested than u are
D-money (2013-12-02 21:22): i know.. its wierd.. cus she like pretty much said she didn't want to be with me, but wanted fwb
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:22): judge her by her actions not her words homie
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:22): she is sending text after text and won't drop the issue.  You think if you were some loser chode she would actually care to know how many girls you've slept with?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:22): nah man.  she is responding and investing here (hopefully) more so than you are
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:23): Options
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:23): 1) Don't respond.  Shit....reopen her tomorrow with something new
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:23): 2) Play into her frame....but you're setting a pattern that is going to do you more harm than good.  Who the fuck is she to tell you what to do?  You think she digs a guy that follows her orders (rhetorical)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:23): OR
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:23): you could take the middle-road and flash some vulnerability style game that Jimmy put me on
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:24): "Hey I think you're okay but I'm not the kind of guy to talk about my partner count.  It weirds me out"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:25): something to that affect where you're insinuating she's weird, you have your boundaries, and the ambiguity of saying she is "okay" ("Wait, why am I JUST okay? What does that even mean!?" will have her hamster wheel spinning
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:25): I'm done D-Money, best of luck. There will be more hoes no matter how u play it
D-money (2013-12-02 21:26): hah k thanks
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:26): keep us posted though either way. So we can all learn and give insight
D-money (2013-12-02 21:27): as a back up, how many is too many partners?
D-money (2013-12-02 21:27): i guess it all depends on the girl
D-money (2013-12-02 21:29) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/abc202c03df00131dbb322000a2d16e3
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:30): hold your ground
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:30): she just sent 3 texts in a row about something she is intrigued about
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-02 21:31): she is bluffing.  and if the small chance she isn't,  she doesn't seem that cool judging by how she is sweating the issue
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 22:42): Just seeing this...
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 22:44) (1x <3): I'd turn it around, like "Honestly I have nothing to hide, but you're being wayyy too pushy. Ru insecure about something?"
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 22:45): Dre$ is right, shes holding her pussy as ransom for some bit of very private information 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-02 22:45) (1x <3): "Lol" would be good too
Nate (2013-12-02 23:07) (3x <3): wierd girl.  Didn't want to kiss me, but sucked my dick until I came
Nate (2013-12-02 23:10) (3x <3): I had to teach her how to do it, she's a fast learner
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 09:55) (1x <3): Weird indeed @ Nate.  But between her mouth on your mouth or on your wee wee, you got the better option
Nate (2013-12-03 10:04): Well she was a virgin, and I did kiss her, but she wasn't comfortable with it. 
Nate (2013-12-03 10:04): Yeah I got the better deal :-) 
Nate (2013-12-03 10:06) (2x <3): I may have to make the next date something activity so she doesn't feel I only want to bang her
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:16): "Jad: @contro. the best opener in my opinion is I like your style said with enthusiasm. "
Marcus (2013-12-03 10:17): What is everyone doing for NYE
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:17): #hopeless
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:17): You could do worse. They miss the point
Nate (2013-12-03 10:18): @Phil 'They'?
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:18): @nate but that is all you want to do
Nate (2013-12-03 10:19): @phil yes but she's 25 and yesterday was the farthest she's ever been with a man
Nate (2013-12-03 10:19): To be honest I'm not sure how to calibrate this situation properly
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:20): Ah fresh meat
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:20): Me either I don't like virgins
Nate (2013-12-03 10:21) (1x <3): I like the dominant feeling that comes with being her first, and instructing her in the ways of love, and making all the deviant stuff I do to her seem normal
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:22): Lol you evil SOB
Nate (2013-12-03 10:24) (1x <3): :)
Nate (2013-12-03 10:27): got the blonde russian tonight, she definitely aint a virgin
Nate (2013-12-03 10:28) (1x <3): It's funny last night was like a college lecture.  She was sitting there holding my dick asking questions like "Where are all the places you can put it" and "People really do anal?"
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:29) (1x <3): That's hilarious and did you point to all the places with your 'pointer'
Nate (2013-12-03 10:29): and wanted me to explain titty fucking and asked if I could cum from it
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:30): Sounds more like 5th grade sex Ed class ;)
Nate (2013-12-03 10:30): yeah a little :)
Nate (2013-12-03 10:31): Apparently the only other guy she's ever done anything with was a total chode
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:38): I daygamed w/ Jad a bit yesterday
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:38): I can tell he's going to be really good if he keeps at this
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:39): What's your criteria for believing that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:39): legit curious
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:39): He's got a great handle on both daygame and nightgame, I've seen him get very fast results @ both
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:40): He has no trouble pulling the physical trigger
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:40): good stuff
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:41): First set of the night yesterday he instadated a girl @ starbucks
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:41): He came out saying he wasn't content, he wanted hotter, w/ more solid interaction
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:41): He's really driven/focused 
Nate (2013-12-03 10:42): There seem to be two types of people who get into this.  People who are socially calibrated who want better results, and people who aren't who want to transform themselves
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:43): Also doesn't hurt that he's an architect, dresses sharp, etc etc
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:43): Yeah people have different starting points
Nate (2013-12-03 10:44): I think Most of the ppl here are the latter, most ppl in the other chat are the former
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:45): I don't see anyone willing to "transform" themselves
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:45): Nate I disagree
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:45): *respectfully disagree
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:46): although I don't know everyone that well, seems like most guys at least from the meetup were socially calibrated...maybe they didnt start out that way
Nate (2013-12-03 10:46): @pippy you're allowed to disagree, and it's implied with respect unless you say "I fuck you disagree" :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:46): based on your story and what i know, you seem like the latter and u massively transformed yourself
Nate (2013-12-03 10:46): I was definitely the latter
Nate (2013-12-03 10:46): err former
Nate (2013-12-03 10:46): err latter :)
Nate (2013-12-03 10:46): haha
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:47): THE FIRST ONE
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:47):  so u were not socially calibrated and u wanted to transform urself
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:47): lol jimmy
Nate (2013-12-03 10:47): yeah
Nate (2013-12-03 10:48): Sandeep is an example of those ppl from the other chat, although his social calibration is worse than mine ever was
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:48): right, seems that way
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:49): it just seemed that at the Closers people most if not all were social calibrated, but dont know for sure if everyoen started out liek that
Nate (2013-12-03 10:49): Yeah
Nate (2013-12-03 10:51): I'm interested to meet Jad and marbles.  Sounds like both were pretty cool at least from the chat
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:54): eh
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:54): I have enough friends
Phillatio (2013-12-03 10:54): I've met marbles he's alright
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:55): btw guys
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:55): is Xander alive
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:55): I'm not going to say I miss the insidious bastard but this is odd.  This has been his longest vacay from Closers
Nate (2013-12-03 10:55): mostly
Nate (2013-12-03 10:57): he's alive
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 10:58): I guess he's busy moving and shit
Nate (2013-12-03 10:58): he was out of town for the holiday too.  Was lucky if he replied to my texts.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 10:59): got it thanks Man
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 11:00): Mark and Xander both are easing their way into pickup retirement
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 11:00): Or at least, groupchat retirement
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 11:00): that's a damn shame but understandable
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 11:00): Prob all for the best - working and stuff 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 11:00) (1x <3): Mark and Xander were the Darth Vader and Sith Lord of this lol
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:03): I'm not the biggest fan of "vulnerability game"
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:06): It's not really a way of building value so much as it is a way of recovering from over-gaming. If she perceives your value as too much higher than hers (I doubt that is going to be a frequent problem, from what I've seen), then she will close off, since she thinks that she is just a pump-n-dump
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:07): @D-Money I'm having difficulty understanding why you seem so invested in these girls. I thought you were spinning multiple plates.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 13:17): Welcome back
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:19): @D-Money If she kept asking me my partner count a billion times, I would just stop responding, since she's being an annoying twat
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 13:29): Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 13:29): whats ur opinion on how it was handled at the time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 13:30): do u think OP's girl will reach out again, as she was bluffing
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:59): Maybe
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 13:59): The question is, do you even want her to? She sounds like she's 8 years old.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 14:15): Always be ready to walk away from shitty behavior
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 14:21): Agreed agreed
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 14:25): Thanks for chiming in @Xander @Jimmy.  It wasn't my situation but I learn from your insights
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 14:25): http://31.media.tumblr.com/0aaca9819b405a3988aee105fd5061a1/tumblr_monfny0qEZ1rvs9wso5_400.gif
Nate (2013-12-03 14:28) (1x <3): Wanted to do an hour of day gaming for lunch.  First girl I approached instadated me to eat lunch.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 14:38) (1x <3): Love it @Nate. Instead of u instadating her, it's the other way around 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:20): Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:21): not doubting u at all and congrats
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:21): could u please share a mini FR once its all said and done
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:21): in terms of opening, how the interaction went and so forth
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:21):  SRU used to do that with Jimmy and I and it really helped us get out of our comfort zones and be more aggressive
Nate (2013-12-03 15:30): I opened with something like "Excuse me.  I saw you walking past as I was headed the other way, and those bright colored jeans drew me back here to talk to you"
Nate (2013-12-03 15:31): Then transitioned into smalltalk after a slight back and forth with asking her where she was headed.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:31): how'd u bridge to instadate
Nate (2013-12-03 15:31): She asked where I was headed, and when I told her she asked if I wanted to come to lunch with her because she didn't have time to chat on the street.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:32): wow
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:32): did u like the girl after having lunch with her??
Nate (2013-12-03 15:34): She seemed somewhat interesting.  Doesn't laugh a lot, which I didn't like, although was easy to tease, which is good.  Doesn't drink, which is bad, but liked that I was adventurous, which is good
Nate (2013-12-03 15:35): I'm meh about her for now, but she had a really nice body for a chinese girl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:35): Nate thanks for sharing
Nate (2013-12-03 15:35): welcome
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:35): that stuff does help a lot in terms of prompting some of to push the boundaries of what's possible
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:36): and makes it easier to visualize success
Nate (2013-12-03 15:36): She instadated me basically solely on my body language, confidence, and smile basically
Nate (2013-12-03 15:36): 1 basically only
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:38): Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:38): i've been  harping on that a lot
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:38): what you say versus how u say it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:38): and u seem to be a proponent of the latter (THE SECOND ONE)
Nate (2013-12-03 15:39): day game is mostly about how you say it.  The energy, confidence, and relaxed nature (or lack thereof) makes a massive difference
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:40): truth
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:40): one thing I picked up in Xanders book was the importance of eye contact
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:40): (ya i've read about it before and understand the importance, hey)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 15:40): so yesterday at GSC that was the main thin I tried to focus on, staring at the girls pupils and what not.  made a big difference in how the interaction went, IMO
Mark (2013-12-03 16:13) (3x <3): the braided shape of my bowel movement indicated a lack of fiber, but the abundance of cold-pressed extra virgin cocunut oil in my diet blessed me with a smooth and painless release
D-money (2013-12-03 16:14): Can I like that twice?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:14): Yes @D-money
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 16:14): I couldn't believe my eyes once I beheld the size of my latest fecus. It glided out of me as smooth as butter
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:14): You can also lick it twice if that's what floats your floaties
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:15): And the chinese are back
D-money (2013-12-03 16:15): Pictures pleeease, these words are not good enough
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:18) (1x <3): http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Y+all+Mofo+s+Need+Jesus.+It+s+true_fd660e_4021231.jpg
Mark (2013-12-03 16:18) (1x <3): as i sat on my throne in a glorious stupor, i looked towards my taint and envisioned a most delightful sight. the gods had bestowed upon me a mythical 'no wipe', that which had been foretold by generations before me but witnessed by none
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:19): Thank you Jimmy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:19): AH YEs, THE SITH lord is back in full effect
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:20): The Shit lord
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:20): hahah
Xander Xone (2013-12-03 16:22): @Mark You have all of the cheese to thank for that 'no wipe'
Mark (2013-12-03 16:30) (1x <3): the clouds parted like a flock of geese and a booming voice reached down from the heavens, 'thou shall not bequeath thy niggardly companions with unwarranted validation, for ye shall be exiled into the fiery pits of beta hell'
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:50): Feel good story of the day: 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-03 16:50): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:54): phuck u jimmy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:56): While in prison, Meiwes has since become a vegetarian.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:56): Meiwes was helpful in the analysis of two suspected cannibal murders 
from 1998 and 2000, in which two young boys were found mutilated.[12]
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 16:56): happy ending indeed

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-03 21:38): Text game: recognized
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:14): A testament to your game
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:14): Attention Closers
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:15): How would you fellas respond, below is the situ and yes this is foreal
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:15): Friend: Invited a girl w/ this message, "L, NYC from a local's eyes-- Meet me at 50th n 5th @ 7-- wink if u hear meh!!" Her response to follow has stumped me...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:15): Her: "Are you peacocking? And will you kino me? Maybe neg me, too. Because that's what you usually do right?"
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:18): Oh shit...
Nate (2013-12-04 12:18): They can either acknowledge they know what those words mean, or not.  
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:18): ABORT!  ABORT!  She's on to us!
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:19): But there must be some context not displayed here that triggered such antiPUA response
Nate (2013-12-04 12:19): if you agree with it, then you play along.  "This is one of those things.  What were they called?  Oh yeah, a shit test.  Did I pass?"
Nate (2013-12-04 12:20): Sounds like your friend came off as fake
Nate (2013-12-04 12:23) (1x <3): or "I'm doing all of those things right now simultaneously in one sentence, and looking good doing them too"
Nate (2013-12-04 12:24): "Someone read The Game"
Nate (2013-12-04 12:25): "Come find out, @7"
Nate (2013-12-04 12:26) (1x <3): "I've got my top hat and magic tricks ready"
Nate (2013-12-04 12:26): I could do this all day
Nate (2013-12-04 12:27) (1x <3): "Put on your sexiest underwear, since you know what to expect"
Phillatio (2013-12-04 12:29): these are fucking gold
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:29): Hm..as entertaining as they are, I don't think those texts will get him actualize the first date
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:29): Except maybe the agree/amplify one w/ the top hat and magic tricks
Nate (2013-12-04 12:30): Well she's shit testing him because A. she's met back pickup artists or read the game or both, and B. She thought this guy came off inauthentic
Nate (2013-12-04 12:30): *bad pickup
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:32): My friend said: "Didn't think I gave her that vibe"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:32): I told him to say: ""Wow I see you read the game. I think I'm supposed to keep plowing and tell you to shut up and meet me at 7!""
Nate (2013-12-04 12:32): Maybe someone else did last night and she's a whiny bitch
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:33): I'd probably go with something like 

"Uh I was actually doing this thing called 'asking a cute girl out on a date' but if u want I'll bring my top hat too" 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:33): Nate all your responses are great
Nate (2013-12-04 12:34): As much as I love positive feedback, some of them are kinda meh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:35): Yeah but they're better than entering a supplicating frame
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:35): @Nate and Jimmy. I sent him ur recommendations
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:35): Jimmy this friend is Lasana by the way
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:37): Gotcha. He did seem a little 'gamey' when I saw him in field once
Phillatio (2013-12-04 12:38): schmitty comes off as very gamy 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:39) (1x <3): Anyone that twirls the girl within a minute of meeting her 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 12:39): Lol ya
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:39): I thought Rich was more of a natural though
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:40): But I've only seen him in action once, at 13th step
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 12:40) (1x <3): So shitty a place, who gives a fuck
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:29): It seems Solas is a favorite date spot amongst Closers 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:29): For midweeek
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:30) (1x <3): I set one up for tonight, a few doors down, at the dimly lit, underground sake bar Decibel.  Will report back its tenability as a good date spot
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:38): Jimbro. Which wench is this
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:38): Nikki Sleighbells 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:39): If u don't bang her in the ass and get her to bring slutty friends to Dillon francis then I will be disappoint
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:39): No pressure
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:40): Attention Closers
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:40): OP (my friend) just got a response from that girl:
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:40): Her: "You can't communicate with girls without memorizing scripts can you"
TiMex (2013-12-04 13:41): What response did he send?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:41): Timex. Good question. I asked him and am awaiting his response
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:41): WHO LIES MORE GUYS OR GIRLS
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:43): Ok here is the update
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:44): Him: "Wow I see you read the game. I think I'm supposed to keep plowing and tell you to shut up and meet me at 7!"

Her: "You can't communicate with girls without memorizing scripts can you"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:44): How should OP respond? The girl is still responding so that's a greenlight to me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:44): Friend: "Text me if ur late!" Only thing I added
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:45): Ugh.  I still stand by my text suggestion. 
TiMex (2013-12-04 13:45): I do like that one
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 13:46): Done. I told him to reply with Jimmy's suggestion
Nate (2013-12-04 13:47): Haha, my off the cuff text is a script
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:47): Well it's prob too late now lol
Nate (2013-12-04 13:48) (2x <3): Honestly I think his best bet at this point is agree and amplify
Nate (2013-12-04 13:50): "Damn, you caught me.  I've been typing in the lines from Don Corleone from the Godfather.  Maybe I should have picked a different movie"
Nate (2013-12-04 13:52): replace the character with your favorite person from your favorite movie
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 13:53): "Yes but honestly, why write anything new when everything that ever needs to be said was already said in The Little Mermaid?"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 14:06) (1x <3): Jimmy. Grand central tonight?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 15:06): Yes

Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 16:56): She's a keeper Nate
Nate (2013-12-04 16:56): If she didn't have a kid I'd marry her right here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 16:57): Lol
Jimmyayo (2013-12-04 16:57): I'd send something back about a StackOverflow error, her breast are too large etc

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 21:50): Phil, excellent fucking job on that initial text to Marie
Nate (2013-12-04 21:50): @Xander I guess deleting tinder was...premature
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:52): You have to make her coooomfortable
Nate (2013-12-04 21:52): and fat
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:52): You have to remind her of things that make her feel safe, like pizza
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:54): After you run some pizza game, it's time to build the attraction
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-04 21:54): Xander. Welcome back
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:55): Push the cocky/funny hard
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:55) (1x <3): But you have to sprinkle in a little bit of vulnerability so that she knows you're human and attainable
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:56) (1x <3): Like a Greek hero, larger than life but tragically flawed
Nate (2013-12-04 21:56) (1x <3): I like to sprinkle a little crack on her, works too
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:56) (1x <3): And then you demand her number, like a rapist
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:56) (2x <3): And you hack her account and geolocate her and rape her if she doesn't give it to you
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:57) (1x <3): But she will secretly like it, because that's every girl's fantasy
Xander Xone (2013-12-04 21:57) (1x <3): A guy who is so turned on by her that he can't help himself
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 02:51): Rah
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 03:01) (1x <3): Har

Nate (2013-12-05 09:13): hot peppers are awesome in cheese
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 09:13): That cheese has a divine creaminess that's hard to describe.
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 09:14): It has been making my bowel movements into a symphony.
Phillatio (2013-12-05 09:22): Need a wing lol
Phillatio (2013-12-05 09:22): Fuck that group

Mark (2013-12-05 10:46): tolerance is always bad
Mark (2013-12-05 10:47): ideally youd alternate between vaping and burning every so and so
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 10:47): yeah i get what ur saying
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 10:47): i think tolerance is good in the sense that after a while u dont have to get dumb high to the point u cannot even go to the grocery store lol

Mark (2013-12-05 11:05): by the artificial structures of society
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 11:05): (sigh)
Mark (2013-12-05 11:06): for we are the movers and shakers
Mark (2013-12-05 11:06): to crush your enemies, to see them fall at your feet -- to take their horses and goods and hear the lamentation of their women
Mark (2013-12-05 11:06): that is our true calling
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 11:06): we're the quakers
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 11:06): for there is that of Game in everyone

Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 13:50): Jads alright by me, hes super focused on getting better. Hes the most active person these days in terms of actually going out 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 13:50): Not just some keyboard jockey chode
Phillatio (2013-12-05 13:52) (2x <3): I'm busy applying for jobs in europe 
Phillatio (2013-12-05 13:53): fuck game

Xander Xone (2013-12-05 13:59): you cant game in western europe or else youll be arrested by the male privilege police
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 14:00): I can ask him to reel it in a little, but tbh, there is little in-field activity lately w/ Closers
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 14:00): we're busy enjoying our lives
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 14:00): What's wrong with field reports. Everyone benefits
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 14:06): I learned from Jimmy's FR from last night, Mark's mini-FR especially the lawyer line, Xander's screenshots of text exchanges
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 14:06): every positivie interaction can be boiled down to: moved toward sex
Mark (2013-12-05 14:06): guys, ive met my one true love
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 14:07): every other one: didn't move toward sex
Mark (2013-12-05 14:07): shes a... wait for it... mold inspector
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 14:07): unless the sole purpose of this group is to e-stroke each others penises over how awesome we appear to be, i'm voting in favor in Jad and his ability to generate FRs
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 14:07): perhaps she can appraise the mouldings on my new apartment
Mark (2013-12-05 14:07): http://www.adventuresofthemoldgirl.blogspot.com/
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 14:08): i dont need others to stroke my penis, im on my own dick
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 14:09): Sounds like ur projecting because Jad is taking more action than u bro

Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 15:46): Why not play w/ Tinder to hold you over?
Phillatio (2013-12-05 15:46): don't give into to the dark side Xander
Phillatio (2013-12-05 15:46): go out and daygame
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:46): i keep getting numbers and then they tell me im creepy
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 15:47): Nothing wrong w/ finding a receptacle for your sperm online
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:48): i must be doing something wrong in the attraction phase
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:48): maybe coming on too strong
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:50): ive been trying to talk dirty more in text
Mark (2013-12-05 15:51) (1x <3): lead with: youre a good girl, and you know it
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:52): its not like they say i'm creepy
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:52): its more the impression that i get
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:53): @Mark okay, im looking for some actual feedback here, thanks
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:53): @Xander
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:53): are u talking about the digits u get from daygame or from tinder?
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:54): its an across the board problem
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:54): i have noticed
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:54): oh ok
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:54): well one thing i've taken away from YaReally
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:55): here fuck it let me find the quote but basically, 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:55): A lot of sexual shit is about pushing her boundaries slightly out of her
 comfort zone, doing a little dance there to show that you’re 
comfortable with it, then backing off to show that you’re not a 
desperate horn-dog, you can back off because you know you’ll both be 
across that boundary again later.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:55): She wakes up to a dozen “good morning!” “hope you have a good day!  let 
me know if you want me to buy you lunch!” txts from orbiter chodes every
 day.  Are any of those txts going to be her top priority to respond to,
 or is her top priority going to be the one that says “you must be 
tired, I saw you outside my bedroom window all night.  perv.”
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:56): Also once you’ve solidified plans to meet up, turn the sexuality off to 
avoid triggering ASD.  She can masturbate to your sexting for weeks and 
love it when there’s no actual plan to meet up, but once it’s 
established that you’ll be meeting up in person (obviously for sex),
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:56): that same sexual texting will often trigger her ASD because now shit is 
“real” and then she flakes because she feels slutty going to meet up 
with you…so pull back and go asexual friend zone once the meet is set.  
Then in person greet her sexually (pull her in for a quick light kiss 
like “god you look good, come here” etc.) and set the tone.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:56):  You CAN go full sexual right to the end, I’ve done it now and then, but
 turning it off once the meet is set is a MUCH higher % play.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 15:57): does that help, i can dig deeper in the archives  but am strapped for time rigfht now
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:58): ill meditate upon it
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 15:58): thanks
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 16:01): yeah, i got some more stuff for ya. i think you're just going thru a stage and based upon negative feedback ur receiving, u will come back to the center a bit and figure it out
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 16:01): Xander:

"ive been trying to talk dirty more in text..."
"i keep getting numbers and then they tell me im creepy"
Mark (2013-12-05 16:02): im sure its unrelated
Jimmyayo (2013-12-05 16:02): Just a happy coincidence
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 16:04): ill tell them stuff like they're making me hard, but maybe im not building into it since i sort of spring it out of nowhere
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 16:05): well i know it's not something anyone wants to do but if u have an example or screenshot of blowing up the account, please share
Phillatio (2013-12-05 16:05): it usually springs out of no where 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 16:05): i've done my share and then some but I delete inbox every once in a while if the shame is too much to bear lol
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 16:05): im not ashamed though. maybe i should be because that would make me change my behavior more
Xander Xone (2013-12-05 16:09): i just feel... numb
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 16:10): (Googles "I just feel....numb)(no movie quote)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-05 16:10) (1x <3): well man, come out to Grand Central today at 6pm for a little bit and socialize

Mark (2013-12-05 22:36): had the most awkward moment with her and my hot roommate
Phillatio (2013-12-05 22:36): Ugh
Phillatio (2013-12-05 22:41): Please do tell mark
Mark (2013-12-05 22:42): date was in my room screaming her lungs out and her roommate comes knocking on my door
Mark (2013-12-05 22:43): and asks us to keep it down
Mark (2013-12-05 22:43): i guess she mustve came home in the middle, thought no one was home
Mark (2013-12-05 22:45): they exchange names for some reason while shes naked
Mark (2013-12-05 22:45): it was dark otherwise i wouldve laughed uncontrollably
Mark (2013-12-05 22:53): what happened to your date phil
Phillatio (2013-12-05 23:05) (1x <3): She was boring and I hate southerners

Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 10:28): The suspense is killing me
Nate (2013-12-06 10:29): @jimmy you actually reply to that chick last night?
Nate (2013-12-06 10:35): Number closed this girl last night.  She was dressed horribly conservative and badly.  It was so worth it.  I could tell underneath the bad glasses and 1820's clothing was a 9 face and 10 body
Nate (2013-12-06 10:35): ironically she was a fashion student
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:38): Can we get a rundown of the interaction
Nate (2013-12-06 10:39): I walked up to her and said something along the lines of "I say you passing by, and underneath those very conservative clothing I sensed there was a fun person"
Nate (2013-12-06 10:39): "Let's find out"
Nate (2013-12-06 10:40): I did most of the talking, she was pretty shy
Nate (2013-12-06 10:40): Said she had a boyfriend, and I said "okay then we'll have a drink" and she said okay...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:40): Nate. Did u feel she wasn't j to it at all because she was shy?
Nate (2013-12-06 10:41): no she was very into it, she was twirling her hair, and fixing her clothing, and shifting
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:41): Sometimes I'll ejectulate early if a girl isn't real responsive but sometimes it's cause that whole 90/10 rule when it comes to opening a set
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:41): Ah ok. Way to keep an eye out for that
Phillatio (2013-12-06 10:41): I never eject early
Nate (2013-12-06 10:41): @pippy that is a mistake new ppl to this make, they eject early
Phillatio (2013-12-06 10:41): let her do the ejecting
Nate (2013-12-06 10:42) (1x <3): if she's still standing there, she wants to be there
Nate (2013-12-06 10:42): just keep talking till she relaxes
Nate (2013-12-06 10:43): Theoretically we have a date sunday after he art eval
Nate (2013-12-06 10:43): Will find out if she replies today
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:43): Ya good stuff. I've started to pick up on the little signs in some sets. Like she will say she has a boyfriend but is still there talking to me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:43): Ur right tho. I ought to do what Phil says and burn it to the ground more
Nate (2013-12-06 10:44) (1x <3): replace more with 'always', unless you genuinely dislike the girl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:44): Nice work on the sarge Nate and thanks for sharing
Nate (2013-12-06 10:44): sure
Nate (2013-12-06 10:44): also got 2 russian chicks numbers too
Nate (2013-12-06 10:44): 1 was very alpha so we'll see if that one goes out with me
Nate (2013-12-06 10:45): not a bitch tho
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:48): Nice
Nate (2013-12-06 10:54) (1x <3): I'm still working on figuring out why I get flakey numbers from interactions I thought were really good.  Might not be enough comfort.  Gonna start recording my conversations
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:59) (1x <3): Nate, It also just happens. So discount some of those solid interactions that turn into flakes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 10:59): I know jimmy and I have been left bewildered when interaction was super solid but girl never responds again
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:00): Flip side as well when u flash number close but girl actually shows up to a date
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:00): Where do u feel like u could improve tho?
Nate (2013-12-06 11:00): getting the girl to invest more, to feel she needs to validate herself to me
Nate (2013-12-06 11:01): some more comfort maybe too
Nate (2013-12-06 11:01): I'm gonna record some and send them to ben and charlie
Nate (2013-12-06 11:01): yeah I know sometimes I get a number in 30 seconds and it's super solid, and sometimes I have a 30 minute conversation and nothing
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:02): Do u find talking to a girl that long (30 min) is productive?
Nate (2013-12-06 11:02): 10 minutes is usually the sweet spot 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:03): For myself, I find around 5 to 10 min optimal 
Nate (2013-12-06 11:03): yeah
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:03): You gotta leave some mystery
Nate (2013-12-06 11:03): usually if it happens that long, its out of circumstance
Nate (2013-12-06 11:03): like one when we ended up going into a restaurant and getting takeout together
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:04): Good stuff fellas
Nate (2013-12-06 11:04): well 30 minutes isn't going to remove all mystery :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:04): I also have the access to B&Cs daygame webinar. If you want to review it again just let me know and I'll email u details
Nate (2013-12-06 11:05): ideally you want to instadate them, but that's often not practical due to stuff
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:05): I dunno...i have mixed feelings about instadates
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:05): If you're going for the SNL then absolutely
Nate (2013-12-06 11:05) (1x <3): pippy their webinar is for beginners, it doesn't really get into this part
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:06): Okay. Offer still stands to other Closers who may want a stab at it
Nate (2013-12-06 11:06): even if you're not going to snl, going into a date automatically makes then next date more comfortable, so it's easier to get to lay
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:07): Yeah but it removes a lot of the mystery
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:08): Build more comfort, lose some mystery
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:08): Yo, I normally don't like to do this but since we are on topic of comfort
Nate (2013-12-06 11:09): over the years some of my strongest dates came from when I ended up sitting in the park meeting them and talked for 2 hours
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:09): I ran into situ via text with that hb7asian from grand central. Basically she wants more comfort but I didn't know how to segue to that
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:09) (1x <3): Whereas after a short 5-10 min conversation you leave her in a state of bewilderment, and during the next 3-5 days until your date with her, she will be thinking "Who the hell was that guy?  Why was he so confident, I wonder what he does..." shit is simmering in her head 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:09): I think the account is toast so I'm just looking for introspection as to how I could do that next time
Nate (2013-12-06 11:10): @jimmy only if she doesn't think "I don't know this guy at all, why am I going out with him", which sometimes happens
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:11): Closers. Any idea how I could of added more comfort in this text exchange. Ya prob should have done it sooner ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/db4c301040be01316e9022000a638017
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:11): O GAWD 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:11): Her texting is fucking atrocious
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:12): Disclaimer: I am terrible at texting and recognize it's a huge deficiency
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:12): And dude it looks like it's far from blown up 
Nate (2013-12-06 11:12): @pippy instead of ..., you could say "alright ask me one question you want to know"
Nate (2013-12-06 11:13): boom, comfort
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:13): "Any idea how I could of added more comfort"
Nate (2013-12-06 11:13): although 'sigh ur no fun' is playing into her bitchyness
Nate (2013-12-06 11:14): what did you ask her?
Nate (2013-12-06 11:14): although "why do I have to answer this" isn't a comfort issue, it's a shit test
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:14): So convo got to point where I asked what here two vices/bad habits are. She doesn't drink meat or drink so I was curious
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:15): She didn't comply so *sigh* ur no fun was best I could muster
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:15): Nate, agreed
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:15): "..." would have been better a text earlier
Nate (2013-12-06 11:15) (1x <3): "I need to find the chinks in your armor to exploit them"
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:16): That's racist
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:16): Haha
Nate (2013-12-06 11:16): lmao
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:16): Lol
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:16): Philatio I agree.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:16): So, Nate I will use ur replies next time
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:16): I don't know how to take it from here tho
Nate (2013-12-06 11:16): @pippy never ever react with frustration to anything a girl says, ever
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:16): I didn't expect to respond twice after I hit her with the "..."
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:17) (1x <3): Obv she wants to keep the interaction going
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:17): I didn't respond to her last night as I was tired of thinking of a response and went to gym instead
Nate (2013-12-06 11:17): @Pippy "Let's hear those vices, I know you've got them"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:17): And yeah I was scared of blowing up account because this was first cute asian from daygame and I'm not abundant with it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:18): Nate, nah, I pressed her twice on the vices. Jimmy can attest. I don't want to keep getting shut down on that
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:18) (1x <3): "Lol is there somwthing you want to hear??" -->

Used two ??'s

You could say...things are getting serious
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:18): Lol Jimmy.
Nate (2013-12-06 11:18): @pippy go read some of krausers text message exchanges where he asks for sexy pics from a girl, for 4 pages of convo
Nate (2013-12-06 11:19): girls respect when a guy doesn't back down
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:19): If u have a link I will def check it out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:20): Basically here are choices 

1) reopen with new topic or thread
2) keep pressing on vices and up the alpha. Tried that already. 
3) scratch my balls and hope the ellipsis text  "..." Will cause her to flood manhattan
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:20): Nate, this girl also verbalizes that she likes being told what to do and to be dominate.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:21) (1x <3): See I tried to plow when she avoided answering the first time ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/577dd3c040c001316e9022000a638017
Nate (2013-12-06 11:22): stop playing into her
Nate (2013-12-06 11:22): "I am a cop.  Put your hands behind your back and tell me your secrets"
Nate (2013-12-06 11:22): actually yours isn't that bad
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:22): How is that not playing into her lol
Nate (2013-12-06 11:23): I didn't completely read it :)
Nate (2013-12-06 11:23): I guess agree and amplify is the difference I would have done
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:24): Hm Nate I agree. I was hesitant as I didn't want to overgame/out alpha myself here. Been there as do that on the regular lol
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:24): Pips, your texts aren't horrible (not the best I've seen but nowhere near the worst) and she's obv somewhat invested, she's asking what more you'd like to know 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:24): I personally really hate gamey texts 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:25): I'm very open to suggestions on what I should do from here. I reckon her wheels are spinning from me not responding two both of her last texts
Nate (2013-12-06 11:25): I think you shouldn't back down, but I'm not an expert so
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:25): Thanks jimmy. As someone who is horrible at texting that means a lot
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:26): Lol Nate. U are our daygame SME and deal with bitchy Russians. U are qualified brotha
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:26): Well all this back n forth over text is a little silly and a waste of time if it's not getting you any closer to a meetup
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:26): But that's just my opinion
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:26): Agreed. We tentatively made plans for Sunday afternoon. Yes yes I know
Nate (2013-12-06 11:26): She asked 'is there something you want to hear", I say go full alpha and say "I want to hear you say "Yes I will do your bidding"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:27): Lol Nate
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:27): I'm not opposed to it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:27): I do kinda see the situ as her wanting some comfort. But I don't want to force that and buy into her frame
Nate (2013-12-06 11:27): I've been really getting into playing the dominant man role lately, it's fun
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:28): Small asian girl from daygame - I'd say comfort is pretty important 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:29): Things we know 

1) chick admitted to liking being dominated and told what to do even if she verbally protests 
2) she takes Molly and goes to electronic shows
3) nyu student living in union square
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:29): I don't think she is this innocent little Korean even tho she may have looked it
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:29): I hate asian girls
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:29): Whoa whoa
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:29): lol 
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:30): they seriously sucky sucky
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:30): Alright fellas. Do we have a consensus on what the best move from here is
Nate (2013-12-06 11:30): apparantly not
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:30): Ok ok
Nate (2013-12-06 11:31) (1x <3): normally I would defer to jimmy on this, but from what you told me I think you should take my suggestion
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:31): What's your goal/intent for your next few texts
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:31): I think that's an important question - then your texts should convey that 
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:32) (1x <3): move to a meet up
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:32): Do you want to be more alpha,aggressive and set your frame up
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:32): Goal is to maintain attraction and solidify plans to meet up
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:32): why bother doing anything else
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:32): Bingo
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:32): just go for the throat and set up a date
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:32): ignore the rest of the texts
Nate (2013-12-06 11:32): I agree with jimmy
Nate (2013-12-06 11:33) (1x <3): err phil
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:33): So how do I do that. Because to respond 14 hours later with plans to meet up May not be the best move
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:33): Please remember tha I am a texting retard
Nate (2013-12-06 11:33): I want to hear you say "I will be there Sunday, 8pm, at <some place>, sharp!"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:34): Jimmy. What was the name of that first spot u went to with Nikki sleigh balls on Wednesday
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:34): Nate, than u for the recommendation. I think ur text conveys my goal
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:34): the last thing she said was "is there something you want to hear??"
Nate (2013-12-06 11:34): @jimmy where did you meet Ms. Balls?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:34): * I know ur text conveys my goal
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:34): Yes Phil that is correct
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:34): Nate, Jimmy and I met her at a concert a couple weeks back
Nate (2013-12-06 11:35): ahh
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:35): "The only thing I want to hear is yessir when I say drinks <day> 8pm"
Nate (2013-12-06 11:35) (1x <3): similar tone to mine :)
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:35): Go it thanks Phil. She doesn't drink but I will use the same idea u and Nate just related
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:36): beginning game is something I have down now. its mid game I suck at
Nate (2013-12-06 11:37): she doesn't drink but does molly, haha
Phillatio (2013-12-06 11:37): strange world
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:39): Pippy, we met up at this underground sake bar Decibel
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:39): Cool place, very dark 
Nate (2013-12-06 11:39): good seating?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:40): Only if u can get seats at the bar stools, otherwise you're sitting across a small table from your date
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:40): I met David Chang there once 
Nate (2013-12-06 11:41): yeah I don't like that kind of seating
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:42): Pippy good luck with your molly poppin wench, sounds like you know where to take it from here
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:42): Ya just got to find a venue. This wench doesn't drink so hey
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:42) (3x <3): Hookah lounge
Nate (2013-12-06 11:42): you can also still meet at a bar and have something non-alchoholic
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:42): Perfect. What's a good one near union square
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:43): Nate, very true. It has been done. I'm not drinking right now tho so hookah is better choice for me truly
Nate (2013-12-06 11:43) (1x <3): I liked his suggestion more than mine, but I made it anyway
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:44): Thanks man
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:44): Pippy, there's a hookah place right next to Solas
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:45): If u can set up a date for hookah, on a fri or sat
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:45): You start there, then go next door and dance, escalate physically
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:45): @ Solas
Marcus (2013-12-06 11:45): My boss hates me 
Marcus (2013-12-06 11:45): Lets say ex-boss

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-06 11:46): Thanks jimmy. I'm not taking this wench to an Edm show until I bang her. She goes crew deep with her Korean mafia crew
Jimmyayo (2013-12-06 11:46): Shit what happened Marcus
Nate (2013-12-06 11:47): @pippy take her to solas then, just don't leave her alone long...

Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:07): I meant flying black children
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:07): if that wasn't clear

Mark (2013-12-11 11:10): black children fly best when you toss them out of a window
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 11:16): I prefer a good drop kick
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:19): I prefer incestuous families

Xander Xone (2013-12-11 11:33): So why not
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:33): my thoughts exactly
Mark (2013-12-11 11:33): i learned that in finance 101
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:33): actually it will probably increase my credit score. since I maxed out my other credit card

Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:38): yeah mine is 599
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:39): at least my transunion score
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 11:39): Phil, if your parents ever buy a new car, u can ask them to help you out and allow them to make u co-signer
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 11:39): they pay off the car note, your credit score improves as a result. ya they'd be doing you a favor no doubt
Nate (2013-12-11 11:39): Not if they pay in cash...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 11:39): Nate. of course not
Phillatio (2013-12-11 11:39): not if they're in the mafia

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 12:02): what are your thoughts on Cloverfield?
Nate (2013-12-11 12:02): well not jump at you horror, but it's a serious movie where you're genuinely supposed to feel the terror of the people 
Nate (2013-12-11 12:03): I never saw cloverfield because I thought the trailer looked dumb
Phillatio (2013-12-11 12:03): I liked it
Phillatio (2013-12-11 12:03): in a sadistic kind of way

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 12:04): I Am Legend scared me for some reason
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 12:04): But 28 Days Later was more terrifying, less of a budget, so yeah
Mark (2013-12-11 12:04): i was living in a dorm on wash sq park when they were filming i am legend
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 12:04): suggest 28 Days Later for those into horror

Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:16): im starting a xander cheese fund if youre interested
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 13:17): What's ur fave cheese, realtalk

Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:24): that red leicester w chili and red bell peppers from trader joes is really good
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:27): in terms of cheeses i have had lately
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:35): Self-enjoyment in vanity. The vain man wants not only to stand 
out, but also to feel outstanding, and therefore rejects no means to 
deceive and outwit himself. Not the opinion of others, but his opinion 
of their opinion is what he cares about.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 13:43): Sauce???
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:45): no sauce just a source

Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:49): that he isnt a little bitch
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:52): he doesnt spare anyone
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 13:52): Well then
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:52): im sure that wikipedia does a better job summarizing him than me
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:53): i like the idea of the ubermensch, of transcending ones humanness
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 13:53): forging your own purpose and moral code
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 13:55): Ok understood
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:01): Claire's response: "my father is a blackbelt" 
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:02): I guess that makes her half blackbelt
Nate (2013-12-11 14:02) (1x <3): lol
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 14:03): Fighting type pokemon are weak to flying and psychic
Nate (2013-12-11 14:04): she's definitely weak to psychic
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 14:04) (1x <3): Use your Mewtwo
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:15): thanks for the suggestion Xander
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:17): that's what I said to her
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:28): "don't know what that means" 
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:28): "I am from a family of all girls"
Phillatio (2013-12-11 14:28): aha hahaa

Mark (2013-12-11 15:55) (1x <3): just dont eat the bread and youre good
Nate (2013-12-11 15:57): I'm eating half of it
Nate (2013-12-11 16:03): I have no idea what possessed me to order that
Mark (2013-12-11 16:03) (2x <3): i believe its called 'hunger'
Mark (2013-12-11 16:04) (2x <3): or self loathing, either one

Nate (2013-12-11 16:22): prosciutto, cappicola, mozzarella, roasted peppers, basil with balsamic garlic vinaigrette 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:22): On ciabatta?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:22): Toasted or no?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:22): Doesn't look toasted
Nate (2013-12-11 16:23): a little toasted.  They were gonna pannini toast it but I asked that they don't
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:24): Good call, the insides would likely slide out from the pressure of the press
Nate (2013-12-11 16:24): Also I didn't want everything melted, and I like my bread on the softer side.  I microwaved it for 40 seconds before I ate it
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:25): Awesome
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:25) (2x <3): My Hero

bad pun intended
Nate (2013-12-11 16:31) (2x <3): Ahh black women.  Texts me 2 hrs after I met her on the way to an interview to ask me if I know anyone who is hiring
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:32): I could use another house servant
Nate (2013-12-11 16:32) (1x <3): yeah but I'm not paying her, that's just for the privledge of me fucking her
Phillatio (2013-12-11 16:33): I could use another sex slave
Jimmyayo (2013-12-11 16:39) (1x <3): Tell her my favorite song is "Black and Yellow"

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 18:30): Mark that was an extraordinary recovery
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 19:06): From what, bubonic plague
Nate (2013-12-11 19:10): mnemonic plague
Mark (2013-12-11 19:11): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syRQ7iShpzY&feature=youtu.be&t=0s
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 19:12): From quant theory to titties
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 19:13): I'm looking for pudenda paradise
D-money (2013-12-11 19:56): Asked girl to dinner, it's about our 3rd time hanging out. Last time she came over and we fooled around but got some LMR. I don't want to pay for her dinner, what should I do?
Nate (2013-12-11 19:57): split the check
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 19:57): D-money. The best way to get out of a headlock is to not get in one
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 19:58): Tell her change of plans and say you had to have dinner with your boss so settle for ice cream. If she acts out call her high maintenance
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 19:59): And try to contribute here more a bit lil, I don't mind but ya might get more robust feedback if we see you more than the weekly "oh shit guys, halp!" All good tho
D-money (2013-12-11 19:59): I kinda want to do dinner though
D-money (2013-12-11 20:00): I just don't want to pay for her
D-money (2013-12-11 20:01): Kk been lurking still though
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:04): We can do dinner right now and you can pay for me
Nate (2013-12-11 20:04): Dude its a third date. Just don't fucking pay. Pretty simple 
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:04): I'm also wondering why you asked her to dinner instead of just drinks
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:04): Sex first then relationship
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:05): Not the other way around
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:05): Hey Xander that's out of line
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:05): Just because she has sex with him doesn't mean she is entitled to a relationship
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:06): D-money. Did u pay for all the shit the last few times u hung out with her?
D-money (2013-12-11 20:10): Yes I did, but only little things, a round of drinks, tea.. That's it
D-money (2013-12-11 20:11): I just felt she needs more comfort
D-money (2013-12-11 20:11): And didn't want to do drinks in case I wanted to work out or do wok later
D-money (2013-12-11 20:11): Plus, guy gotta eat, so it was convenient
Nate (2013-12-11 20:13): If she dumps you on a third date for splitting checks, she was never going to sleep with you
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:16): I'm not saying she's entitled to a relationship, I'm saying that you shouldn't even consider giving her one until she has had sex with you
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:17): You're already doing relationship-y kind of things for her
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:20): Ah shit Xander, i was making ur chain there
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:20): D-Money, it's perfectly within ur power not to go out on this dinner date and not to pay for it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:20): ur tryng to find a way to minimize the awkwardness.  But it's hard.  You're similar to the hot girl who once in a blue moon turns into a fat revolting uggo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:21): She expects u to to be that provider to pay for her shit but then outta no where ur gonna be liek "nah, lets split this babe"? It's doable but it wont be the smoothest thing ever
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:21): Invite her over to your place to watch a movie. If she doesn't spring for it, next her
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:21): Enough of this overinvestment bs
Marcus (2013-12-11 20:31): Hey d-money, look invite her over to your place and  tell her u will order take out when she gets there (you may not need to order anything its already there ;) ) 
Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:32): You're gonna give her your Asian noodle
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:37): D-Money so what's it going to be
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:37): Don't be an OP about this

Xander Xone (2013-12-11 20:39): D-Money just wants a girl to love him unconditionally for who he is, the real him
Marcus (2013-12-11 20:39): Pippy please start using tunyurl
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-11 20:40): no Marcus

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:26) (1x <3): unless u k new that and i am the one getting trolled
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:26) (1x <3): lol there was no way u couild know, i think u joined the chat when he started tapering off and lurking
Nate (2013-12-12 11:27): I have to bother to read what they said to be trolled
Nate (2013-12-12 11:27): Actually he gave me some phone numbers when I just started
Nate (2013-12-12 11:27): One girl was really into me until she saw my face...
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:28): so what youre saying is that g-lover is the epitome of gay
Nate (2013-12-12 11:28): yes
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:30) (1x <3): he's not that bad of a dude based on fe interatctions
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:30) (1x <3): him and some of the RSD-heavy guys (GangerofLove for example) do lack a certain amount of "depth"
Nate (2013-12-12 11:30): I saw him once at 13 step without knowing it was him
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:30) (1x <3): He was pretty aggressive overall.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:30) (1x <3): @Xander. i take it then u wont be attending the free tour next week for RSD lol
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:31): I think most of the pick up guys lack depth in their personality
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:31): they've become a culmination of rouitines and techniques 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:31): and they're boring
Nate (2013-12-12 11:31): I did notice Tyler did seem to love banging low self esteem club sluts
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:31): they can't talk to guys anymore
Nate (2013-12-12 11:32) (1x <3): Listening to him vs Krauser is like seeing a carnie side show vs a man
Nate (2013-12-12 11:33): I might go because it's free tho
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:33) (1x <3): Phillatio

Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:44) (1x <3): Imagine that, guys being boring who spend all of their free time trying to pick up girls
Nate (2013-12-12 11:44): I know, losers
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:47): I spend all my free time playing smash
Phillatio (2013-12-12 11:47): much more productive

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:49) (1x <3): Alright, no offers to share that text convo breakdown
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:49) (1x <3): it shall be a distant memory
Nate (2013-12-12 11:50): You could have just posted the link...
Nate (2013-12-12 11:50): If you mean the one that was for your 'friend' from before?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:51) (1x <3): nah the one im talking about is that asian chick where Phil offered up "The only thing I want to hear is "Yessir" when I say Hookah Sunday at 8pm"
Nate (2013-12-12 11:51): ahh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:51) (1x <3): lol the other one u mention legit was for a "friend" but i was eqaully culpable for how it turned out
Nate (2013-12-12 11:51): Didn't she agree to meet you?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:52) (1x <3): ya ya but she flaked
Nate (2013-12-12 11:52): ahh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:52) (1x <3): so i got some insight/analysis from YaReally and a couple others, thought I mgiht share ifanyone is interested
Nate (2013-12-12 11:52): I'm interested, although I suspect her flaking had more to do with the initial interaction
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:52) (1x <3): no this was a legit flake
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:53) (1x <3): anyways, Nate, I'll craft an email and send it to ya asap
Nate (2013-12-12 11:53): I get flaked on a lot, but yeah there are sometimes legit ones
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:53): i could have basically told you everything that CH pointed out
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:54) (1x <3): Xander.....okay?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:55) (1x <3): Nate, check ur email.  
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:55): in regard to the girl calling out your friend
Nate (2013-12-12 11:55): @pippy grats
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:55) (1x <3): yeah but what's the point in stating that.  u weren't present at the time, ur feedback would have helped then,no doubt
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:56): there isn't a point
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:56): im essentially masturbating
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 11:56) (1x <3): ah ok
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 11:59): The fact that your friend even had to think about how to respond to that girl demonstrates that he isn't in the right frame of mind
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:00) (1x <3): ya no kidding'
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:00) (1x <3): im equally culpable as well
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:00) (1x <3): instructing on how to achieve that frame of mind
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 12:01): Stop giving a shit about what girls think and start amusing yourself
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:06): Do you not think about calibration?
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:08): I don't
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:08): I don't think about pick up at all 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:08): anymore
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 12:08): same here
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:09): Hm
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:09): So what is your main way of finding new chicks? Day game, night game, online, social circle?
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 12:10): At this point, online, since it has something like a 50% date to bang ratio
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 12:10): I'm all about efficiency these days
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:11): I see
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:12): I like day game
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:12): but I don't really do it
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:12): lack of motivation in the cold
Nate (2013-12-12 12:12): I've been doing efficiency day game lately.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:12): I still do both day and night game, and imo calibration is required for both
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 12:13): What's "efficiency day game"?
Phillatio (2013-12-12 12:14): drive by day game
Nate (2013-12-12 12:14): Spending as little time outside as possible.  Approaching girls walking my direction, or in cafes, or making a short a convo as possible to get the number
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 12:14): somehow, i feel like you're not doing calibration correctly if you have to think about it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:20) (1x <3): Xander, in terms of feedback
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:20) (1x <3): i'd prefer to learn how to think about it correctly then being told that i'm doing it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 12:20) (1x <3): teach a man to fish all that.

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 14:54) (1x <3): Rational Male did a write up on it.  If you have time, check Parts 1 and 2 which OP linked to
Nate (2013-12-12 15:02): Actually seems like the wife was justifiably worried
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 15:02) (1x <3): Nate, what do u mean
Nate (2013-12-12 15:03): She was justifiably worried that her husband would think she was a slut and leave her.  Just from his reactions he never would have accepted it if he found out before they got married.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 15:03) (1x <3): true
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 15:04) (1x <3): im debating whether she was prudish because he was 1) unattractive to her 2) came off as really judgmental
Nate (2013-12-12 15:04): Sounds like he has no self respect and probably made judgemental comments about other women in the past
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 15:04) (1x <3): yeah
Phillatio (2013-12-12 15:31): love how theredpill was voted as the second worst subreddit
Nate (2013-12-12 15:31): Maybe most politically incorrect...
Phillatio (2013-12-12 15:31): and /u/FriendZonedAndBitter
Phillatio (2013-12-12 15:32): is one of the persons complaining about it

Phillatio (2013-12-12 15:48) (1x <3): too bad you don't have any more pot.. that usually facilitates converstation 
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:50) (1x <3): i just realized that i havent eaten all day
Mark (2013-12-12 15:51): hehe
Mark (2013-12-12 15:51): last night after smoking with the girl i thought it was going to get me hard again
Mark (2013-12-12 15:51): but i just started analyzing all of the flaws with her body since she was lying there naked
Mark (2013-12-12 15:51): didnt really work out to my expectations
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:52): you should have thought of me
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:52): that would have gotten you hard
Mark (2013-12-12 15:52): i wouldve, but i didnt want to ejac straight away
Phillatio (2013-12-12 15:53): you should have thought of kfc
Mark (2013-12-12 15:53): again, i didnt want to misfire within 20 seconds
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:54): im coming for your ramen
Mark (2013-12-12 15:54): i opted for more gentle side b's
Mark (2013-12-12 15:55): im coming in your ramen

Mark (2013-12-12 15:56): shes 20, hope they dont card
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:57): nice
Mark (2013-12-12 15:58): i got the best bit of advice from a friend the other day
Mark (2013-12-12 15:58): instead of going to a large eastern european city like budapest, we should go to a secondary city
Mark (2013-12-12 15:59): girls there are less used to seeing foreigners 
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 15:59): isnt that what roosh was saying
Mark (2013-12-12 16:00): idk havent read much roosh
Mark (2013-12-12 16:02): lol
Mark (2013-12-12 16:03): this girl is getting her jimmies rustled because i called her dorky in a text
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:03): like a whale dick
Mark (2013-12-12 16:03): i can tell this date is going to be fun fun fun
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:05): three funs for good luck
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:06): going to solas 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:06): I think I'll join you
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:06): you have a date tonight Phillatio?
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:06): ah yes
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:08):  don't
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:08): I want to go out tho
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:08): rejection is better than regret 
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:10): lets go out tonight
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:11): and steal some drinks
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:11): sounds like a solid 
Mark (2013-12-12 16:13): goddamn
Mark (2013-12-12 16:14): this ho is getting so butthurt that i called her dorky
Mark (2013-12-12 16:14): better be some retarded lost in translation thing
Mark (2013-12-12 16:14): otherwise, she is going to be the worst date ever
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:15): maybe she looked it up and saw that the etymological root was "dick"
Mark (2013-12-12 16:16): she mustve left half of her brain in siberia
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:17): why does it take longer to make a female snowman?
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:17) (2x <3): you have to hollow out the head.
Mark (2013-12-12 16:19): the shit i put up with for some gap, man
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:20): bahaha
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:20): gefilte fish
Mark (2013-12-12 16:20): had to strap on a bib for that one
Mark (2013-12-12 16:29): this girl has never had anyone call her dorky
Mark (2013-12-12 16:29): and she literally looked it up in a dictionary
Mark (2013-12-12 16:29): fucking shoot me
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:29): I told you
Mark (2013-12-12 16:30): she should be glad i broke her dork cherry
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:30) (1x <3): (dork) jerk: a dull stupid fatuous person
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:30) (1x <3): thats the basic google definition
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:31) (1x <3): and she probably took fatuous to meaning fat
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:31) (1x <3): lol
Mark (2013-12-12 16:31): its totally not accurate in the way real people use the term
Mark (2013-12-12 16:31): w/e
Mark (2013-12-12 16:31): date has been salvaged 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:31): "Someone who has odd interests, and is often silly at times. A dork is also someone who can be themselves and not care what anyone thinks."
Mark (2013-12-12 16:31): shes apologizing to me now
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:31) (1x <3): no doubt u  meant it as her being slightly goofy or whatever
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:31): that's a better definition 
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:33): at least the date isnt completely fercockt
Mark (2013-12-12 16:34): (no text) ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/640x3768.jpeg.1e96c06045a301316ea222000a638017
Mark (2013-12-12 16:34): what a fucking shitshow
Mark (2013-12-12 16:35): cant remember the last time i apologized to a girl
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:35): yeah that was something
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:38): shes meshuggina
Nate (2013-12-12 16:38): she was having a bad day and being a bitch to you in response...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:38) (1x <3): what gulag did u meet this girl in, Mark?
Mark (2013-12-12 16:39): i do understand the whole dorky being improperly defined thing
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:39): oy gevaltz
Mark (2013-12-12 16:39): so w/e its a wash
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:39) (1x <3): good save tho
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:39) (1x <3): u calibrated to the situation and did what u had to do
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:40): well I mean 
Mark (2013-12-12 16:41): it was like walking in a minefield... who knows what others words she hasnt heard of
Nate (2013-12-12 16:42): sounds more like she's really insecure, translation would not have mattered so much as her taking things to literally
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:42): sounds like it
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:42) (1x <3): nate: Google "dorky definition"
Mark (2013-12-12 16:43): all women are insecure, but the definition for dork is abnormally harsh
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:43) (1x <3): i think if he called her silly it woulda been ok, but whatever
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:43): why do we have to keep using the word calibration
Nate (2013-12-12 16:43): pippy, doesn't matter.  It's like telling a girl she's a slut.  She shouldn't be expecting your serious
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:43): I would have just sent her the definition of dork
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:43) (1x <3): Xander, cause i fucking feel like it
Mark (2013-12-12 16:43): nate that depends on where you are in the interaction
Mark (2013-12-12 16:43): and the type of girl she is
Mark (2013-12-12 16:44): anyways... now this date tonight just got a whole lot more interesting
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:50): oh, come on pippy
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 16:50): dont be a dork
Phillatio (2013-12-12 16:50): heee
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 16:50) (1x <3): lol
Marcus (2013-12-12 17:08): Love the bathroom line at Starbucks no one is a customer. 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:11): anyone looking to get really annoyed 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:11): http://youtu.be/f23CPcTdY2M
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:11) (1x <3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f23CPcTdY2M&feature=youtu.be
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:12): cameraman is such a white knight little bitch
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:12): she shop lifted by the way
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:13): blond attractive girls are used to getting what they want so she's throwing a little tantrum 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:13): of course real talk she'll probably never get any kind of prosecution 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 17:13): because she has a vagina
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 17:15): ugh
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 17:15): women
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 17:19) (2x <3): "You start your life crawling out of one and you spend the rest of it trying to get in one"
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 17:37): trying is what beta males do
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 17:39) (1x <3): http://foundercode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/yoda.jpg
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 17:47): i see you winding and grinding up on that pole
Marcus (2013-12-12 18:28) (1x <3): I think I have a business idea. Hoes on wheels haha
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 18:30): is that like meals on wheels
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 18:47) (1x <3): Marcus. Call it.."Hoyota"
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 19:03): How about some next level shit
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 19:05) (1x <3): http://www.nyartbeat.com/list/event_opening
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 19:05): List of art openings (free drinks)
Mark (2013-12-12 19:47): FUCK YES
Mark (2013-12-12 19:47) (1x <3): finally found my bottle of viagra
Mark (2013-12-12 19:47): tonights gonna be a good night
Nate (2013-12-12 19:50): viagra sucks.  cialis ftw
Mark (2013-12-12 19:52): i dont want a boner at work no thx
Nate (2013-12-12 19:53): except for a 3 day erection, the symptoms are way easier.  No purple vision or sinus issues
Mark (2013-12-12 20:01): ive only had purple vision when i snorted it
Nate (2013-12-12 20:02): maybe i took a bigger dosage
Nate (2013-12-12 20:03): I don't mind a 3 day erection.  Not really much different than my normal state anyway
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 20:30): Fuck hard. Flirt harder.
Nate (2013-12-12 20:32): Fuck hard, fuck harder
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 20:33): Are you fucking that girl yet
Nate (2013-12-12 20:36): Flake.  Welcome to my life
Nate (2013-12-12 20:38): I'm gonna set a world record for flakes
Nate (2013-12-12 20:40): I would cry but I have no tears left
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 20:46) (1x <3): Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and persevere 
Nate (2013-12-12 20:51): I'm attempting to kill my liver right now.  It's been bad
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 20:52) (1x <3): http://static.tumblr.com/khswifo/ygLllcy5v/damon_drinking2.gif
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 21:00): @Nate cut that shit out
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 21:00): why dont you hit up some other girl who youve banged before who likes you
Nate (2013-12-12 21:00): Ran out of those
Nate (2013-12-12 21:01): What I should have done was gone out and found some new ones
Nate (2013-12-12 21:01): But I'm self sabotaging
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 21:02): you can go out right now
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 21:02): ive been sleeping on my wooden floor all day
Nate (2013-12-12 21:03): I could, but I'm half drunk and don't feel like going out myself, and I have dates theoretically tomorrow and saturday, until those flake too anyway
Nate (2013-12-12 21:05): Playing company of heroes
Nate (2013-12-12 21:09): I really should stop this self defeating behavior.  I'm only hurting myself...
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 21:09): yep
Nate (2013-12-12 21:09): Long habit...
Nate (2013-12-12 21:10): Started when I spent 10 years in pain.  I had a fun life.
Nate (2013-12-12 21:16): Course excuses
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 21:37) (1x <3): Nate you've come a long way man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 21:38) (1x <3): recognize
Nate (2013-12-12 22:17) (1x <3): That doesn't mean I can't recognize when I'm being a bitch
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 22:27): Uh oh ; photo URL http://i.groupme.com/768x1280.png.78ae288045d40131dbc522000a2d16e3
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:38) (1x <3): I reluctantly daygamed @ GCS tonight, was in horrible state
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:39): Bitched around for a bit but just couldn't get myself to approach - had just rec'd a 5 paragraph text from a chick that wants to stop seeing me
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:41): Forced myself to do 2 approaches (thx @ pippy for pushing me).  2nd one ended well, with less-than-solid plans to grab drinks next week
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:42): We've been doing this very beginner-level 2-approaches-a-day thing for about 3 weeks, it's been helping 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:42): I find my sets are hooking better, i can "snap" into state quicker
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:45): Texts so far w/ HB7 "meg" - a FIT student:

Me: Hey this is James
Her: Hi
Her: I couldn't find a good hat [she was out shopping for a hat]
Me: Wrap your head w/ your scarf, new fashion statement
Her: Haha did you get anything at Zara?
Me: Shirt tie and underwear. No i won't model them for you.
Her: Haha
Nate (2013-12-12 22:45): I got my recorder yesterday.  I'm gonna start recording my sets and figure out why I'm getting flakes
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:48): Good idea
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:48): Do you have any inkling of an idea why that might be?
Nate (2013-12-12 22:49): Honestly, not really.  I feel like they are really strong when I meet them, and then for whatever reason it dies
Nate (2013-12-12 22:49): I think I have too much tunnel vision. I've been doing the same thing too long
Nate (2013-12-12 22:50): That's why I'm going to record them.  Objective people can look at it and say "Yeah that was wrong", and I can fix it
Nate (2013-12-12 22:51): I'm sure it'll be obvious when it's pointed out to me
Nate (2013-12-12 22:51): I always knew I was going to have to be in it for the long haul
Xander Xone (2013-12-12 22:54): Thanks for the share Jimmy, appreciate the honesty
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 22:55) (2x <3): Go fuck yourself Xander 
Phillatio (2013-12-12 23:16): Well then.
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-12-12 23:16): Phillatio has left the group.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 23:31) (1x <3): Xander what's the matter with u man
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-12 23:31) (1x <3): unless u genuinely meant that towards Jimmy, no  need for it. 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-12 23:33): Troll's gonna troll
Jimmyayo (2013-12-13 00:11): Boy it got really awkward in here
Mark (2013-12-13 01:27): my russian bitch went home
Mark (2013-12-13 01:27): wtf happened in here
Mark (2013-12-13 01:30): why did jimmy tell xander to fuck himself, seems uncalled for, im confused
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 09:28) (1x <3): There's only so much snark and sarcasm that one can take Mark 
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 09:29) (1x <3): especially in a situ where Jimmy put himself out there a bit.  There level of trolling in this chat has become too high
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-12-13 10:27): Phillatio has rejoined the group
Phillatio (2013-12-13 10:27): lol hey there
Phillatio (2013-12-13 10:37): Trolling is part of learning game. You guys so realize that right. Teasing, dealing with shit tests, flirting, playfulness these are all derivatives of trolling.
Phillatio (2013-12-13 10:37): Plus it's hilarious
Nate (2013-12-13 10:43) (1x <3): I don't mind the trolling as much as the bad animated gifs...
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:21): I don't mind anything
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:21) (1x <3): I see it differently
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:21) (1x <3): instead of solid feedback and some insight into failed pick-ups and texts
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:22) (1x <3): all i see is sarcastic responses and boasting of pickups where it was already in the bag
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:22) (1x <3): and beyond that, it's usually just a form of validation seeking behavior.  "Hey guys, I never fuck anything up, let's see this exchange with a girl I already banged, Learn from my awesomeness" type shit
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:23) (1x <3): and shit, if no one needs to keep learning or trying to get better at game, then what's the point other than to try to prove to random dudes how awesome we are lol
Nate (2013-12-13 11:26): Pippy I know you mean well, but sometimes the opposite is happening in your direction.  Instead of honest feedback and hard answers, we get eternally positive cumbaya.  Support is nice, but real honesty is sometimes met with hostility over platitudes
Mark (2013-12-13 11:26): hehe cumbaya
Nate (2013-12-13 11:26): Both aren't wonderful
Mark (2013-12-13 11:29): i try to post helpful shit
Mark (2013-12-13 11:29): also like to come here to enjoy myself 
Mark (2013-12-13 11:29): when work is boring, which is always
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:30) (1x <3): i think a lot of the alpha posturing here is bullshit Nate.  A lot of that hard answer is really just done to make one feel better about themselves with supposed superiority
Nate (2013-12-13 11:31): Well if I'm acting like an idiot or doing something self destructive, I'd rather people tell me
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:31) (1x <3): Mark thats the thing, u have a trove of useful knowledge and insight
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:32) (1x <3): but getting that out of u is like pulling teeth.  maybe closers is the wrong forum for that kind of discussion
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:32) (1x <3): last week with a text exchange, Nate, Phil and Jimmy chimed in and helped turn my situ around
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:32) (1x <3): but rarely does that happen
Nate (2013-12-13 11:33): Rarely are people asking direct questions.
Mark (2013-12-13 11:35): right, if you want answers, you have to be willing to do some of the work, as in ask specific questions
Mark (2013-12-13 11:35): give value to get value
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:35) (1x <3): ironic coming from you, i'd say 90% of anything u type is trollish in some way
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:36) (1x <3): which is a damn shame considering u can bring a lot to the table
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:36) (1x <3): then again, with my buddies from back home, we arent having logical discourses all day, a lot of it is around talking shit and posting memes
Mark (2013-12-13 11:36): 90% of this chat is unsubstantial 
Nate (2013-12-13 11:37): Pippy that pretty much reflects what in person is like too.  90% of what people talk about hanging in person is bullshit and fooling around.  Sitting at work is boring
Mark (2013-12-13 11:37): like nate will post text msgs and ask for pointed advice
Mark (2013-12-13 11:37): dont recall pippy posting anything like that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:38) (1x <3): https://i.groupme.com/2645f70040cd0131dbb322000a2d16e3.preview
Mark (2013-12-13 11:38): point being, its hard to give advice in the abstract sense
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:38) (1x <3): that was an example from last week where Jimmy, Nate and Phil managed to rally and helop me out
Mark (2013-12-13 11:39): it all just becomes academic masturbation 
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:39) (1x <3): okay so here's my two cents nothing anyone tells me is actually going to help me long term
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:39) (1x <3): that kind of improvement is something i'll have to do 
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:39) (1x <3): maybe you guys could help me in the moment but that doesn't really help me
Nate (2013-12-13 11:39): well people have told me things that steered me in the right direction
Nate (2013-12-13 11:39): the work is still mine tho
Mark (2013-12-13 11:40): i agree with phil... were here to help each other out, but everyone must walk their own path alone
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:40): honestly getting help is only going to hold you back long term
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:40): to a certain extent
Mark (2013-12-13 11:40): its like going into a class discussion without doing the required reading
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:41) (1x <3): my main grievance is the amount of trolling and lack of helpful advice, especially considering if one has the experience to give a fair point of view
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:41) (1x <3): like yesterday when jimmy took the time to post his FR and put forth the text exchange
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:42) (1x <3): that IMO is solid contribution.  Posting a screenshot when the deal is already seal? Who benefits from that? Me thinks that kind of shit is validation seeking behavior to show-off
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:42): so
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:43) (1x <3): so lil ni99a, ur alphaness u try to project here gets snuffed when ur trying to seek validation
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:44) (1x <3): id rather see u fuck up and understand why so either 1) others can learn 2) others can provide feedback so u can learn
Mark (2013-12-13 11:45): no one is projecting anything lol
Mark (2013-12-13 11:46): a vital component of tight game is a thick skin
Mark (2013-12-13 11:46): you tend to get sore easily pippy, imo
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:46) (1x <3): projecting/fronting
Nate (2013-12-13 11:47) (1x <3): it's also being able to recognize bullshit.  Xander's trolling last week was statements that were so out of character, and yet noone was questioning them.
Nate (2013-12-13 11:47) (1x <3): Girls say bullshit all the time, and reading between the lines is a really valuable skill
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:47) (1x <3): i just see rationalization for some of the shitty behavior and i think the group has way more potential than that
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:48) (1x <3): and Mark, soreness = me getting my feelings hurt, it's more of a frustration as it seems the elitist behavior manifested from bashing Gotham has spilled over here., and that's not really productive
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:49): why would you even acknowledge it at all
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:50): you realize that you're validating his behavior
Phillatio (2013-12-13 11:50): you take things way too seriously
Nate (2013-12-13 11:51): Also when they are posting the end results of their successes, it's because frankly we're guys and like to talk about banging chicks.  It's not always about learning.  If you want to know more (sometimes I do) about a particular interaction you can always ask
Nate (2013-12-13 11:51): Sometimes it's just a "hey I banged this chick last night"
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:52) (1x <3): in which case i just see it as a "cool story bro" type situ
Nate (2013-12-13 11:53): yes.  would you rather we talk about taxes?
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:53) (1x <3): Jimmy, boasting about last nights number close pales in comparison to him taking the time to give his thoughts and a rundown on the situation
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:53) (1x <3): lol yes Nate, please that'd be great.  please more hyperbole
Nate (2013-12-13 11:57): @pippy both of those happen
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:58) (1x <3): i dont want to argue the content cause thats not something that needs moderating
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 11:59) (1x <3): im calling out the fact that a lot of the asshole behavior isnt that productive and the format some of it is delivered isnt realizing its potential
Nate (2013-12-13 12:01): and I'm calling out that people also need thicker skin.  not everything is a personal attack just because someone is trolling or saying something to get a reaction
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:04): yup yuo
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:05): okay lets get back to trolling
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:05): this is way to serious for me
Nate (2013-12-13 12:05): you got angry at me one time just because I was trying to get you to do more approaches, like it was a personal attack on you.  as if I was doing it just to feel better about myself, instead of trying to push you into it out of a genuine desire to help.
Nate (2013-12-13 12:06): you can tell me to stop, but you were genuinely pissed off.
Nate (2013-12-13 12:06): like it was a personal attack
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:09): it was
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:09) (1x <3): merry christmas bitch
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 12:11) (1x <3): Nate that's not my beef. It's the lack of actionable advice or feedback that gets supplanted by alpha posturing
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 12:12) (1x <3): Like Phil is attempting to do above in order to placate his alpha master Xander lol
Nate (2013-12-13 12:12) (1x <3): no he's just tired of our group therapy session
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:13): no one is my alpha master mr. pissy 
(SYS) GroupMe (2013-12-13 12:36) (2x <3): Mark changed name to Alpha Overlord
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:38): ahahaa
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:38): my mouth is full of nuts
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 12:39): I would expect nothing less
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 12:46): I'm canceling my date for tonight
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 12:47): I'm already in the danger zone with my $$$
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 12:47): Look Pippy, an instance of failure
Alpha Overlord (2013-12-13 12:47): yeah science!
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:55): science bitch
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:59): can't wait to watch die hard this christmas
Phillatio (2013-12-13 12:59): best x-mas movie ever

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 13:04) (1x <3): Look Pippy, an instance of failure
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 13:04) (1x <3): meh, i would say your lack of a social group and reliance on benzos is an instance of failure, but hey
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 13:04) (1x <3): http://images.wikia.com/degrassi/images/d/d9/Thumbsup-alec.gif
Alpha Overlord (2013-12-13 13:04): benzos and meth*
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 13:05) (1x <3): good catch
Phillatio (2013-12-13 13:10): okay that got old
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 13:11) (1x <3): my apology, that was shitty and reactive of me to do
Phillatio (2013-12-13 13:12): you're getting a lot of love her
Phillatio (2013-12-13 13:12): e
Marcus (2013-12-13 13:14): Pippy, don't think with ur emotions. If you need to let go, type them out and then press the backspace until all the angry is gone. 
Phillatio (2013-12-13 13:34): feeeelings

Xander Xone (2013-12-13 15:37): I prefer diarrhea to constipation

Xander Xone (2013-12-13 15:38): I took Imodium once and then was constipated for many days

Marcus (2013-12-13 15:48): no plot
Nate (2013-12-13 15:48): There was a plot, it was just pretty full of holes
Marcus (2013-12-13 15:49): i felt it was a waste of 2 hrs of my life
Nate (2013-12-13 15:49): That's not a movie where I pay attention to plot details though.  It's one where I watch Riddick kill pppl

Nate (2013-12-13 15:52): Because the ending ruined the whole point of the movie

Nate (2013-12-13 15:53): That was the entire point.  The movie ruined it by making the vampires savages instead of normal people trying to survive

Xander Xone (2013-12-13 17:01): Not just saying advice, Phil

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 17:03) (1x <3): as in, approching the guy, scouting him out, making it happen
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 17:03): What a joke
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 17:03) (1x <3): but at no point did she say how her ability was to get committment from the guy
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-13 17:04) (1x <3): it was like a 7'0 athlete bragging about dunking the ball.
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:04): yeah all a girl needs to do is open her legs
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 17:04) (1x <3): "I learned how to spread my legs faster"
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:05): who knows maybe she looks like a wookie 

Xander Xone (2013-12-13 17:05) (1x <3): Not unlike my genitals
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:05): now that's heart worthy 
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:05): it came from the heart 
Marcus (2013-12-13 17:06): u forget the part where a female doesnt like to feel like a slut
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:07): oh she likes to feel like a slut
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:07) (3x <3): she just doesn't want her friends to know
Xander Xone (2013-12-13 17:07): Yes, but the you-go-girl feminist culture is about erasing that evolutionary feeling
Marcus (2013-12-13 17:07): yeah that
Alpha Overlord (2013-12-13 17:11): phil come to stone after work
Phillatio (2013-12-13 17:11): get stoned after work? yes sir

Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-14 11:26) (1x <3): Works pretty well around this time
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:26): Not bad
Nate (2013-12-14 11:27): Maybe I'll use that next week, not pinging this weekend
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:27): I'm looking for a ho-ho ho
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-14 11:29) (1x <3): So then u can go further
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-14 11:29) (1x <3): Her: lol I want blah blah blah
Nate (2013-12-14 11:29): I just read this on reddit comment...
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-14 11:29) (1x <3): You: you've been too naughty for that
Nate (2013-12-14 11:29) (1x <3): >It's as if your SO's vagina is somehow springing to life and going nom nom nom nomon your cock in the hottest and most loving way.
Pippy Long Sausage™ (2013-12-14 11:29) (1x <3): Keep plowing
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:31): Yes, there is plenty of room to riff off of it
Nate (2013-12-14 11:31): I do like plowing...
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:32): I think you've been over gaming Nate
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:32): And that's contributing to your flakes
Nate (2013-12-14 11:33): That's certainly possible.  How does one act when one isn't gaming?
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:35): You know how you've been texting a lot
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:36): I want you to obey the golden ratio
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:36): Except instead of giving her 2/3 of everything, give her 1/4
Nate (2013-12-14 11:37): I haven't been texting all that much with most of the women who have flaked on me
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:37): I think you're giving away your excitement
Nate (2013-12-14 11:37): That's certainly possible
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 11:38) (2x <3): Pretend like they are garbage that you have deigned to offer the pleasure of your company
Nate (2013-12-14 11:47): I feel my intial interactions have almost as many issues
Nate (2013-12-14 11:47): that are contributing
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 13:29): Holy shit, my dump is colossal
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 15:51): And this one is liquid
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 15:53): I need to stop putting the hot pepper flakes on my dollar pizza. Oh, how it burns!
Nate (2013-12-14 15:54) (1x <3): That was a long 'I'll be right there'
Xander Xone (2013-12-14 16:16): 🔥😩🔥

Nate (2013-12-16 10:23) (1x <3): hmm, the only personal question had for me in text who's taking me to the nets game tonight was "Where do you live"...  This is probably gonna be a fun night
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 10:42): At least she didn't ask you if you had a job for her
Nate (2013-12-16 10:43): haha yeah
Nate (2013-12-16 10:43): she lives in park slope, so I'll just 'escort' her home
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 10:45): Why, that's a mere 30 minutes from me
Nate (2013-12-16 10:45): ol
Nate (2013-12-16 10:45): lol
Nate (2013-12-16 10:45): Although given the lateness of the game I won't be suprised if that doesn't happen
Nate (2013-12-16 10:46): yeah Xander, eiffel tower
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:48): heh

Nate (2013-12-16 10:49): Did you actually sleep last night?
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:49): meth not even one weekend
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 10:50): Sort of
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 10:50): I went to sleep around midnight but woke up every hour or so
Jimmyayo (2013-12-16 10:53): You may want to lay off the benzo's
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:54): and meth
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:54) (1x <3): you're heading down a dark path Xan man
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 10:54): It's more the sleeping on a floor
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:54): I'm really worried
Nate (2013-12-16 10:54): yeah I'm kinda seconding the whole intervention thing...
Phillatio (2013-12-16 10:55) (2x <3): the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem
Xander Xone (2013-12-16 11:01): Weetabix: the cereal for those who lack tastebuds
Jimmyayo (2013-12-16 11:01): Do you need an air mattress?

Xander Xone (2013-12-16 13:04): I guess that Weetabix kind of grows on you over time

Nate (2013-12-16 18:02): After tomorrow I'm not going to be at work until New Years eve...
Phillatio (2013-12-16 18:06): that's fun
Phillatio (2013-12-16 18:07): I'm writing some artisan javascript for a job in amsterdam
Nate (2013-12-16 18:07): freelance cashola?
Phillatio (2013-12-16 18:07): at booking.com
Nate (2013-12-17 10:27): This is what happened last night...
Nate (2013-12-17 10:28): Went to the game, talked about random stuff most of it.  Around 1.5-2 hrs in I kissed her quickly, and again about 20 mins after.  She suggested we go to a bar instead of waiting till the end of the game, which I agreed...
Nate (2013-12-17 10:29): At the bar she opened up about her supermodel mom and her unfair standards, and we escalated a bit, makeout.  She started showing me her body and putting my hands on part of it.  We kissed again.  Suddenly she says "I can't do this tonight" and before I can pay she leaves the bar, even without her gloves...
Nate (2013-12-17 10:29): I follow her and she's in the middle of the street (drunk) catching a cab.  She says I can come to her place but only for a little while...
Nate (2013-12-17 10:30): At her place I listen to 10 minutes of bullshit about her cats.  I start kissing her and such and she starts saying variations over and over of "why can't you be the guy that does stuff with me instead of all the other guys who just want to fuck me"
Nate (2013-12-17 10:30): I tell her I do want to do stuff with her, and that she is turning me on also
Nate (2013-12-17 10:31): She goes in circles with the same thing
Nate (2013-12-17 10:31): At some point she just starts asking me to leave over and over, and before I get all rapey I do
Nate (2013-12-17 10:31): Don't know what I should have done, and not done
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:16): You can't always get the bang
Nate (2013-12-17 12:24): I was just curious what I could have done to improve that situation
Nate (2013-12-17 12:25): I thought it was funny that she expected me to not bang her when my opener to her was a comment about how her short skirt makes her ass look fantastic
Nate (2013-12-17 12:26): Especially curious what I should have done/said when she kept talking about guys always wanting to only fuck her
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:30) (1x <3): Whenever girls give me that shtick about how they are so hot and I probably only want to bang them, I act disinterested and say things like "meh" and "who said I want to bang you?"
Nate (2013-12-17 12:30): Even if you're in the middle of feeling them up?
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:32): Yep
Nate (2013-12-17 12:32): yay chick logic
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:32): Especially then
Nate (2013-12-17 12:33): I'll try that next time, even if it doesn't make sense :)
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:35): You basically let her hamster run wild last night
Nate (2013-12-17 12:35): yeah
Nate (2013-12-17 12:36): I knew it was happening, but I was too drunk/horny to think of intelligent words to use...
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:36): You let your dick think for you and she won as a result
Nate (2013-12-17 12:36): Yep
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:37): When she was showing her body off to you at the bar, that was a perfect time to take control of the frame
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:37): But instead you let her dictate everything
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:38): You should have been like "Ew" when she put your hands on her
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:38): Or tried to resist and pull your hands away
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:38): She wanted your validation there and she got it
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:39): Twas the beginning of the end
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:39): Because then the momentum was in her favor for the rest of the night
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:40): Honestly I would have just let her leave when she left the bar
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:40) (1x <3): Every girl who has pulled that bullshit on me is always so surprised when I don't follow them
Nate (2013-12-17 12:41): Yeah, although she wasn't really thinking straight, but yeah probably should have let her leave
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:41): Too much pull and not enough push in general, methinks
Nate (2013-12-17 12:42): yeah sounds about right
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:42) (1x <3): When are chicks ever thinking straight
Nate (2013-12-17 12:42): I need to read some more articles on push-pull, still don't do enough
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:44): Not pushing enough demonstrates that you're still afraid of losing girls
Nate (2013-12-17 12:45): I did plenty of teasing, but definitely not enough pushing
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:45): You need to be more of a dick
Nate (2013-12-17 12:46): Yeah, it's a new thing to me
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:47): Every guy has an inner dick just as every girl has an inner slut
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:47): It's time to unleash yours
Nate (2013-12-17 12:48): I don't know how
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:48): Just assume that every girl is a slut and act accordingly
Nate (2013-12-17 12:50): I guess I need to hear examples, my brain no get exacts...
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:52): You're still acting so happy every time you have a date with a girl
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:52): Being with women makes you feel very validated
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:53): But once you realize that they are nuisances and start wondering things like, "What does this girl have to offer that won't bore me to death like the last five?"
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:54): Then you start getting to the nut
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:54): of the thing
Nate (2013-12-17 12:54): ahh
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:55): Tell me Nate, what was so special about this girl, now with the gift of hindsight
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:55): She seemed to give you the standard annoying shit tests and hamster logic
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:55): Doesn't sound like much fun to me
Nate (2013-12-17 12:55): Umm, basketball tickets
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:56): So you were her eunuch for the night
Nate (2013-12-17 12:56): Nice legs
Nate (2013-12-17 12:56): yeah I suppose you're right
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:56): I see nice legs every time I walk down the street
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:57): Now, once you realize that she's flawed, just like every other woman, you can start acting accordingly
Nate (2013-12-17 12:57): yeah I suppose there wasn't much interesting about her
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:57): They aren't special
Nate (2013-12-17 12:57): If I'm measuring a girl on the free shit she's offering...
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:57): At least not until they give you actual reasons to start investing
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:57): a la good girl game by securing your commitment
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:58): Like giving you morning blowies and cooking you delicious meals
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 12:58) (1x <3): Until then, she's just some bitch, like every other bitch
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 13:00) (1x <3): SHE IS NOT A UNIQUE SNOWFLAKE
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 13:05): Well, if you want to use her for free shit, then use her for free shit
Nate (2013-12-17 13:06): Not unless I'm banging her.  Otherwise don't feel like it
Xander Xone (2013-12-17 13:06): You're so focused on the bang that it's making you all pull
Nate (2013-12-17 13:06): Very true

Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 12:42): I think it was putting him in a bad headspace
Nate (2013-12-18 12:43) (1x <3): I think he needs to learn not to take stuff so seriously
Marcus (2013-12-18 12:44): 'why so serious'

Phillatio (2013-12-18 12:55) (2x <3): "Honor is a strictly male abstraction, women do not understand it.

Xander Xone (2013-12-18 13:37): Pretty much none of them
Nate (2013-12-18 13:38) (1x <3): he especially doesn't have 'ask a woman on a date'
Phillatio (2013-12-18 13:40): sad
Marcus (2013-12-18 13:45): he missed 'change a spare'

Xander Xone (2013-12-18 13:57): It reminds me of when I started reading red pill
Nate (2013-12-18 13:58): Me thinks the white guys don't wanna marry the indian girl because she's a whiney little old bitch, not because she's indian
Phillatio (2013-12-18 13:58): the good ol' days
Phillatio (2013-12-18 13:58): well both
Phillatio (2013-12-18 13:58): indian girls are fucking gross
Phillatio (2013-12-18 13:58): so hairy 
Nate (2013-12-18 13:58): big tits
Xander Xone (2013-12-18 13:59) (1x <3): If they aren't from the upper caste, then they tend to be gross
Xander Xone (2013-12-18 13:59): They have basically had a eugenics program in place for over 1000 years
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:28): There are some pretty amazing Indian girls
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:29): Rare, but they exist
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:29): Indian fobs have some of the worst BO I've ever encountered - both male and female
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:37) (1x <3): "I'm on my period
This happened to me a while back. Invited me home for the first time and then during pre-sex makeout she tells me she's on her period. I hop off of her and walk towards her bathroom as I say over my shoulder, "Do you have a preference on which towel I grab?"
She was too stunned to say anything, so I just grabbed the darkest one I saw."
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:38): bad ass
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:38): LMR something I've definitely dealt with unsuccessfully 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:39): Hahaha
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:39): Shit that's a good one, filed under "bloody sex tips"
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:40): I've heard the "i'm on a period" so many fucking times - usually I'll just settle for a bj 
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:40): coulda fucked her
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:42): I'm okay with that though - I just want to bust a nute
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 14:42): *nut
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:43) (1x <3): nah I'd always rather fuck her
Phillatio (2013-12-18 14:43): most girls suck at giving head

Nate (2013-12-18 15:20): I haven't finished one episode of house of cards and it's already my favorite show
Nate (2013-12-18 15:21): I did find peak sauce there
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:21): my success with women chart over the past 9 months
Nate (2013-12-18 15:21): what is the other axis?
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:21): months
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:21): and success
Nate (2013-12-18 15:21): lol
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:21): pretty much didn't go anywhere until august
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:22): I consider that my actual start in game
Nate (2013-12-18 15:22): dammit, I want to watch this show more than I want to go on a date
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:22): oh keep watching
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:22) (1x <3): it gets a lot better
Nate (2013-12-18 15:22): I peaked success about 2 months ago, and have been dropping ever since
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:23): I'm about to jump up to the next level
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:23): I can feel it
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:24): I don't think its been dropping
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:24): maybe plateauing  
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:24): which feels like dropping
Nate (2013-12-18 15:24): Well I've been trying things I'm not good at, and having less success as a result, but you're right
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:25): ;)
Nate (2013-12-18 15:25): Trying to intake red pill stuff has a lot of side effects
Nate (2013-12-18 15:26) (1x <3): The main character's wife is more alpha than 95% of guys
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:43): and yet notice how she is around francis
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:43): he dominates her world
Nate (2013-12-18 15:43): oh he is more alpha by far.  the comparison is what makes it so dramatic.
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:44): yes well he's also a complete sociopath
Nate (2013-12-18 15:44): Well so far I've only seen him be shrewd, only on the second episode now
Phillatio (2013-12-18 15:44): you'll get there
Phillatio (2013-12-18 16:12): Tyler knowledge bomb 
Phillatio (2013-12-18 16:13) (1x <3): "when you're new you fear attractive women, when you're intermediate you feel turned on by attractive women, when you're advanced you feel turned on by yourself" 
Phillatio (2013-12-18 16:13): that's pretty awesome
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:25): I'm sooo full
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:25): Ate too much
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:28) (3x <3): Man Gaylife is sooo useless. 
Phillatio (2013-12-18 16:41): "'We pushed so hard for equal rights, for having the right to work, for having equal status, we pushed so hard to have choice.
'But what we hear from many mums is: I have no choice, I have to work, I don't love my career, my childminder is taking half my salary and I'd rather bring up my children myself but I can't afford to."
Phillatio (2013-12-18 16:42): feminism at work 
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:50): Jimmy thanks 4 agreeing. 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:50): Lol
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:51) (1x <3): Jimmy Steve aoki is playing tomorrow at lavo
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:51): For $100,if I had a job I would have went :) 
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:52): Tbh didn't like lavo very much
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:53): Why not?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:53): Lavo is the real deal
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:54): Idk. Didnt feel conformable.. Maybe bc I was solo, but I had lots of chicks open me
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:54): Comfortable 
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:55): 1oak vs. Lavo
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:55): I haven't been to 1oak
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:55): Same crowd pretty much
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:55): 1OAK is a tougher door since there's no cover
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:56): I need to check that out.. How do I get in
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:56): W/ a fly hunny, early on a weeknight
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:56): How early 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:57): I think they open at 11?
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:57): Okay that not that early
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:57): Do u think its possible getting in solo? 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:57): If ur a regular
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:57): Crap. 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:58): Not if it's your first time + you're not a fashion model
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:59): I guess I got to go in my work cloth (swim suit) 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:59): Provocateur - toughest door in the city
Then No. 8 and 1Oak
Then Avenue
Marcus (2013-12-18 16:59): No. 8 that's one of the clubs in the dream hotel 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 16:59): Yep
Phillatio (2013-12-18 17:00): where does phd fit into all of this
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 17:01): Easier than the aforementioned clubs
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 17:01): But not by much
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 17:03): Each club has a certain style/aesthetic it tries to maintain with its clientele. PHD is the broadest for that - lots of models, fashion industry, but also finance/office types, international crowd, etc.  A little bit of everything
Marcus (2013-12-18 17:03): Its cheaper renting an escort for an 1 hour than paying some of those covers :) 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 17:03): That's why I like PHD so much, its a diverse crowd

Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 17:27): Haha where is this?
Phillatio (2013-12-18 17:40): "I am willing to pass laws to ensure that 50% of all Fortune 500 CEOs are women, if we also legally mandate that 50% of all imprisonments are of women, and 50% of the jobs that involve working with heavy machinery, being outdoors in inclement weather, inhaling toxic fumes, or apprehending dangerous criminals are also occupied by women."
Phillatio (2013-12-18 17:40): dope
Xander Xone (2013-12-18 18:05): Something like 95% of all workplace deaths are men
Phillatio (2013-12-18 18:06): including the military 
Phillatio (2013-12-18 18:06): that's some motherfucking food for thought
Xander Xone (2013-12-18 18:07) (1x <3): Man, Williamsburg is ridiculously nice
Xander Xone (2013-12-18 18:08): The contrast between here and Crown Heights couldn't be greater
Phillatio (2013-12-18 18:10): well the difference is greater when compared with dumbo
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 18:25): Dumbo is where the nouveau riche have all moved to 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 18:26) (1x <3): Williamsburg is where the rich hipsters from CT w/ trust funds dwell
Marcus (2013-12-18 18:33): @jimmy 1oak yelp review
Marcus (2013-12-18 18:35): Williamsburg is mad expensive 
Marcus (2013-12-18 18:38): @phil go to Australia if you want women on heavy machinery ~ was chatting up these two chicks in west village - one worked on one of those called big machines 
Marcus (2013-12-18 18:40): Fox
It's hard to be self aware though. I've met many awkward puas who have no clue on body language, social norms and proximity.
Jimmyayo (2013-12-18 18:41): Sigh, why do I even try anymore
Marcus (2013-12-18 18:41): i dont know

Nate (2013-12-24 14:37): you too :)
Xander Xone (2013-12-24 17:59) (1x <3): Worthy I deemed this man, and ripe for the sense of the earth; but when I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a house for the senseless. Indeed, I wished that the earth might tremble in convulsions when a saint mates with a goose.
Xander Xone (2013-12-24 18:00) (1x <3): This one went out like a hero in quest of truths, and eventually he conquered a little dressed-up lie. His marriage he calls it.

That one was reserved and chose choosily. But all at once he spoiled his company forever: his marriage he calls it.
Xander Xone (2013-12-24 18:00) (1x <3): That one sought a maid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once he became the maid of a woman; and now he must turn himself into an angel.

Careful I have found all buyers now, and all of them have cunning eyes. But even the most cunning still buys his wife in a poke.
Phillatio (2013-12-24 18:55) (1x <3): HELLO TITS MEGEE

Xander Xone (2013-12-26 16:19): "If I wanted to shake this tree with my hands I should not be able to do it. But the wind, which we do not see, tortures and bends it in whatever direction it pleases. It is by invisible hands that we are bent and tortured worst."
Xander Xone (2013-12-26 16:19): Then the youth got up in consternation and said: "I hear Zarathustra, and just now I was thinking of him."

Zarathustra replied: "Why should that frighten you? But it is with man as it is with the tree. The more he aspires to the height and light, the more strongly do his roots strive earthward, downward, into the dark, the deep—into evil."

Xander Xone (2013-12-27 20:16): I'm in Brooklyn
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 20:16): i don't know what a night bazaar is
Jimmyayo (2013-12-27 20:23): bkbazaar.com
Nate (2013-12-27 21:15) (2x <3): lmao.  I had a 2 hrish second date with a girl, we were getting along really well, talking about sex, and lots of other stuff.  Walk around the corner to the front of my apartment.  Pull out my key...
Nate (2013-12-27 21:16) (2x <3): and she says "I'm not going to your place" and walks away before I can even talk
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 21:16): you fucking rapist
TiMex (2013-12-27 21:18): Damn that's cold
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 21:19): or should i say, failed rapist
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 21:19): rape harder next time!

Nate (2013-12-27 21:20) (1x <3): Every time I think women are crazy, they prove that no, they are much more crazy than that
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 21:23): Well, as Nietzsche would say
Xander Xone (2013-12-27 21:23): If you go to women, don't forget the whip!
Nate (2013-12-27 21:23): God dammit, I kissed her and she was getting over a cold too.  Probably got myself sick for nothing

Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:08): Girl approaches the bar to get a drink, he goes in and within 3 min make out. 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:08): She goes back to her friends
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:08): Few min later I see she's surrounded by 3 tall ass white guys showering her with attn
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:08): So I tell him that
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:11): He goes in, right up to his target's face and says "Wtf Sarah, what is this BS? You're just gonna fuck me last night and say that ur in love with me, and now ur whoring out w/ these assholes?"
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:11): Completely straight faced, and he put his arm around her 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:12): The 3 guys just back away and talk among themselves 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-28 12:12): He extracts her and brings her back to the bar for another makeout

Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:20): oh hi nate
Nate (2013-12-30 16:20): hey phil
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:21): how goes it
Nate (2013-12-30 16:21): basically like I said above.  Once I get better I'm gonna start a 30 day challenge tho
Nate (2013-12-30 16:21): gonna do at least 30min-1hr of night game every night for 30 days, plus day game
Nate (2013-12-30 16:23): how are you?
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:23): good
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:24): pretty much the same
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:24): not much has changed in the past month actually
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:25): probably more depressed than ever
Nate (2013-12-30 16:25): After seeing the rsd hotseat I realized I suck at game and I want to get much much better.  Gonna take a lot of work.
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:25): yea
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:25): Everyone needs some work
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:26): at something
Nate (2013-12-30 16:26): I need a lot.  Fortunately I'm very motivated to make it happen
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:26): sweet
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:27): I'm pretty not motivated 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:27): so good for you
Nate (2013-12-30 16:27): if you've been hanging out with xander and mark I understand why.
Nate (2013-12-30 16:28): You guys have been the happy fun group lately
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:30): lol 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:30): just a bit
Nate (2013-12-30 16:35): Since my schedule doesn't allow me to do late night game all the time and still retain some self of sanity with sleep, I'm gonna do after work game.  Less change of pulling, but mostly I want the practice in conversation
Nate (2013-12-30 16:36): *chance
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:37): gotcha
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:37): I think you should just focus on your strong suit 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:37): which is day game
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:37): I'm not sure why you think night game is going to help you
Nate (2013-12-30 16:38): The problem is I realized that deficiencies in my conversation game are holding me back, as well as my mindset.  Night game just gives me an easier venue to practice a lot
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:39): hm
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:39): I suppose
Nate (2013-12-30 16:39): I watched how tyler and julien talking to women in every setting, and realized just how much I need to improve
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:40): okay
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:41): I mean, is the end goal to be like tyler or julien 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:41): cause I kind of think they're losers
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:41): maybe not julien I don't know enough about him. 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:41): tyler is a fucking pansy 
Nate (2013-12-30 16:42): I don't frankly.  I think you've just not seen much of them
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:42): fair enough
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:42): I haven't
Nate (2013-12-30 16:42): In person and in field video tyler comes off as very level headed, self aware, driven, and humble
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:43): idk about humble 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:43): from what I've seen
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:43): lol 
Nate (2013-12-30 16:43): In person talking to guys he is, not to women ;)
Nate (2013-12-30 16:44): Tyler has a hot girlfriend who works for him, lets him sleep with random chicks, and takes home girls for threesomes...
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:44): well then
Nate (2013-12-30 16:45): I mean I'm not knocking how far I've come, but it was eye opening seeing how far I have to go.
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:46): I see
Nate (2013-12-30 16:46): I want to get there, to the point where I can easily take home 9's and 10's and not really care anymore that they are hot.  That kind of abundance is very appealing
Nate (2013-12-30 16:47): They talked about how at this point they have as much fun fucking around as they do pulling girls, because it's so easy for them
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:47): gotcha 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:47): how's the physical therapist thing going?
Nate (2013-12-30 16:48): she's not very reliable, especially during the holidays
Nate (2013-12-30 16:48): when she's here she's great, but if she doesn't get better with that after new years, I'm gonna go through the sessions I've paid for and dump her
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:49): nice
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:50): that should probably be pretty high on your priority list 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:50): getting in shape and all that
Nate (2013-12-30 16:50): it is, although I don't think that has anything to do with how good my game is.  I want to do that because I want to be in shape, not for girls
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:51): well yea 
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:51): I think it can make a huge difference 
Nate (2013-12-30 16:51): will definitely improve my quality of life
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:51): right
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:51): and I think it will improve your game
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:52): by a visible margin
Nate (2013-12-30 16:52): maybe, although my game isn't bad because I'm out of shape.  Saw some videos of tyler and julien when they were fat and hadn't showered and they were still pulling 10's
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:52): well yeah but they had to have really good game
Nate (2013-12-30 16:53): true
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:53): to compensate
Nate (2013-12-30 16:53): well I want that too, although I don't feel the need to have handicaps
Phillatio (2013-12-30 16:53): gotcha
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:23): Hello people
Nate (2013-12-30 17:23): Hello Jimmy person
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:25): How's it going man?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:25): Have fun w/ ur pops?
Nate (2013-12-30 17:25): Yeah, the museum was interesting, and we went to a tasty dinner
Nate (2013-12-30 17:26) (1x <3): I told him you sent your love :)
Nate (2013-12-30 17:27): How are you?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:29): One sec almost home
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:33): I've spent the last 3 straight days at home w/ this blonde Asian chick 
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:33): Bought some fuzzy handcuffs and blindfolds yesterday, I made her wear them out in public walking home lol
Nate (2013-12-30 17:34): lol nice
Nate (2013-12-30 17:34): sounds like you had a miserable time ;)
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:34): The worst thing about her is she's not 3sum-friendly
Nate (2013-12-30 17:34): aww
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:35): We were at pacha and some girl wanted to go home w/ us...
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:36): I'm gonna try to not see this wench for a week or two, I feel early-onset one-itis 
Nate (2013-12-30 17:36): yeah sounds like you like her quite a bit
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:38): I do. Had my eyes on her for a really long time, so when I finally got her, I lost sight of my mission to maintain a beautiful harem
Nate (2013-12-30 17:38): well a particularly fine girl will do that.  How did you know her?
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:39): Social circle. She was dating  a buddy's best friend for a year. Met her at a NYE party 1 yr ago
Nate (2013-12-30 17:40): ahh
Nate (2013-12-30 17:40): happy anniversary tomorrow...
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:40): Have u been able to game lately?
Nate (2013-12-30 17:41): not the last few days, except incidentally.  Email closed a girl waiting for my dad, but it didn't go anywhere.
Nate (2013-12-30 17:41): Yesterday I slept most of the day
Nate (2013-12-30 17:41): I'm probably the most motivated I've ever been to change my fortunes though
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:44): Awesome 
Nate (2013-12-30 17:44): After new years gonna try a 30 day challenge, at least one kind of one
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:46): Andres is doing one too
Nate (2013-12-30 17:46): cool
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:49): He did one last spring iirc, improved dramatically 
Nate (2013-12-30 17:49): My major focus this time is going to be self amusement and talking about whatever I feel like
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:53): Is that your main sticking point right now
Nate (2013-12-30 17:53): I have a lot of sticking points.  Figured I'd have to start somewhere and felt that having more fun that isn't dependent on someone else was a good place to start
Nate (2013-12-30 17:54): Right now to be honest I don't even know what all of the things are I'm doing wrong.  My next day game session I'm recording them to help trying and figure it out
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:56): 😕
Nate (2013-12-30 17:58): �
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:58): Kinda funny, im thinking about doing the opposite...
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:59): Been gaming too hard lately, job, exercise, everything else has been suffering
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 17:59): Meaningless sex is starting to lose its appeal 
Nate (2013-12-30 18:00): Well I've been rather lacking lately in meaningless sex...
Nate (2013-12-30 18:00): but yeah, part of the exercise is to find a way to game a lot without sacrificing my life
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 18:02): What's everybody doing for NYE?
Nate (2013-12-30 18:02): Excellent question
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 18:04): Everything around town is super expensive and prob ridiculously crowded
Nate (2013-12-30 18:04): yep
Nate (2013-12-30 18:12): ironic that contro is talking about nicki minaj since I remember you saying you banged her
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 18:13): Lol what? I never banged Nicki minaj
Nate (2013-12-30 18:13): oh okay, I guess my memory is playing fun tricks
Jimmyayo (2013-12-30 18:14): I think I recall the guys here talking about it at some point
Nate (2013-12-30 18:19): I should probably pick a party
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:10): Nate you can come with me to Brooklyn if you want. House party
Nate (2013-12-30 19:13): Sounds fun, and keeps me from spending too much on cover charges :)
Xander Xone (2013-12-30 19:14): Hmm
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:15): Well it's $30 cover. All of it goes to charity. But free booze and food all night
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:16): My cousins new place
Nate (2013-12-30 19:16): well considering I was looking at $160 covers, that's nothing
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:16): She throws big parties
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:16): Last 2 New Years I went to her parties. Snl
Nate (2013-12-30 19:17): nice
Nate (2013-12-30 19:17): That's what I like to hear :)
Xander Xone (2013-12-30 19:18): Sounds like fun
TiMex (2013-12-30 19:18): Lemme know. Starts at 9

Nate (2014-01-02 14:36): I still feel shitty, but not as bad
Nate (2014-01-02 14:36) (1x <3): @Xander, your body is getting tired of being abused
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:37): That's true. I feel really nauseous. I think it's all of the trigger points I have been exacerbating by frequent drinking and not keeping up with massage
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:39) (1x <3): I don't think you're tindering enough
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:39): I can't keep going on this way
Nate (2014-01-02 14:40): Xander, you don't have to drink and stay up super late to bang girls.  Just go to bed at a normal fucking hour
Nate (2014-01-02 14:40): And don't take stimulants

Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:40): Well, I was tindering just now whilst peeing out of my asshole
TiMex (2014-01-02 14:42) (1x <3): You need hydration and probiotics probably man
TiMex (2014-01-02 14:42): Go eat a ton of kimchee
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:48): do lots of squats 
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:48): like 400 of them
Nate (2014-01-02 14:48): Also stop eating cheese and carbs only
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:49): and go bang my sister 
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:49): she needs a good lay
Nate (2014-01-02 14:49): I volunteer
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:49): she's got a thang for russians
Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:49): hairy men gets her hamster spinning
Nate (2014-01-02 14:50): I've got a little russian.  I'll give it to her.

Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:56): I can't so squats, Phil. My knee is still messed up

Phillatio (2014-01-02 14:57): I want to taste your anguish 
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:57): I'm not eating cheese and carbs only. Mostly protein
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 14:59): I'm not drinking and staying up super late to bang girls, I'm doing it because I enjoy it
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 15:00): Ever since I started college, I got into the bad habit of terrible sleep patterns
Nate (2014-01-02 15:02) (1x <3): That will do more damage to you than practically anything
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 15:02) (1x <3): I'll be honest, I hate sleeping
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 15:02) (1x <3): Completely irrational, but it feels like wasted time in a finite lifespan
Phillatio (2014-01-02 15:05): uhh duh
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 15:08): This snowstorm is a little worrisome
Nate (2014-01-02 15:09): Mainly because I don't own a pair of boots
Phillatio (2014-01-02 15:09): mainly because its not coming
Nate (2014-01-02 15:09): I hope so
Nate (2014-01-02 15:10): Annoying trainer was 45 mins late this morning.  Her excuse was she went to the hospital... for a hangover.
Nate (2014-01-02 15:10): I spent about 5 minutes laughing at her
Phillatio (2014-01-02 15:11): hahaha
Phillatio (2014-01-02 15:11): that must have been some hangover 
Nate (2014-01-02 15:11): She apparantly doesn't often drink a lot
Xander Xone (2014-01-02 15:12): Mmm, hospital
Nate (2014-01-02 15:13): I love sleeping.  If I don't get normal sleep I feel like shit all the time

Phillatio (2014-01-06 15:15) (1x <3): its easier when you have a giant orange hunting jacket ^
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:15) (1x <3): Dude, I was such a pimp at the Levee last night
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:16) (1x <3): Is that Brooklyn?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:16) (1x <3): Sounds familiar 
Nate (2014-01-06 15:16) (2x <3): wburg
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:17) (1x <3): Yeah. Free cheese balls, $4 whiskey shot and beer, free darts and board games, extremely hot beezies
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:18) (1x <3): Nice
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:18) (1x <3): I'm gonna do a lot more Webster hall and pacha for a few wks
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:19) (1x <3): Its so fun and relatively easy to finger barely (??) drunk legal sluts rolling on molly
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:19) (1x <3): On the dance floor
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:20) (1x <3): I'm gonna do a lot more Brooklyn
Nate (2014-01-06 15:20) (2x <3): I think word that order wrong is
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:21) (1x <3): Gonna start by hitting up everything on this list: http://brokelyn.com/best-dive-bars-in-brooklyn/
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:24) (1x <3): I weep for Phil, as he has returned to GayLife.
Nate (2014-01-06 15:24) (1x <3): I never left.  It's actually a lot better recently
Phillatio (2014-01-06 15:25) (1x <3): haha 
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:25) (1x <3): I'm just sick of the whole "pua community"
Phillatio (2014-01-06 15:25) (1x <3): I enjoy throwing in a snide remark
Phillatio (2014-01-06 15:25) (1x <3): every once and a while
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:25) (1x <3): Too many sexual market rejects
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:26) (1x <3): Who then make getting laid the main cornerstone of their lives rather than one facet
Nate (2014-01-06 15:27) (1x <3): I can understand, as someone who is markedly worse than all of you.
Nate (2014-01-06 15:27) (1x <3): Which is why I'm still there
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:27) (2x <3): Oh, poo poo
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:28) (1x <3): Xander Xone
"Too many sexual market rejects"

Well that's gets every PUA into this shit, getting marginalized by the sexual market
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:29) (1x <3): It's understandable (and expected) that they start making this the focal point of their lives
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:30) (1x <3): It makes me worse to be around it, though
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:30) (1x <3): Despite whether or not it's understandable
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:31) (1x <3): For me, sometimes it can hurt, sometimes it can help
Nate (2014-01-06 15:31) (2x <3): The chat has no effect on me either way unless someone I respect is talking
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:32) (1x <3): I guess seeing a lot of beta-behavior can put one in a bad headspace 
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:32) (1x <3): You can't help but let it make you worse
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:32) (1x <3): It's called mirror neurons
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:32) (1x <3): YOU'RE A MIRROR NEURON
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:32) (1x <3): That's why hanging out with losers all of the time makes one into a loser
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:33) (1x <3): Or hanging out with any group of anyone all of the time makes one into whatever that group is
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:33) (1x <3): True 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:33) (1x <3): Which is why I formed Closers
Nate (2014-01-06 15:34) (1x <3): I don't hang out with guys from the chat unless I respect them
Phillatio (2014-01-06 15:36) (1x <3): :-D
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:37) (1x <3): Gay, GAY

Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:52) (1x <3): You should demand satisfaction
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-06 15:54) (1x <3): SATISFACTION SATISFACTION 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 15:55): life is not worth living
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:56) (1x <3): Took you long enough to realize that
Jimmyayo (2014-01-06 15:56) (1x <3): It depends on whose life we're talking about
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 15:56) (2x <3): I wouldn't fuck her with your dick
Phillatio (2014-01-06 16:02) (1x <3): heheh
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:05) (1x <3): why cant i have that
Nate (2014-01-06 16:08) (1x <3): If you want his dick you'll have to cut it off
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:09) (1x <3): these testosterone injections are giving me mood swings
Nate (2014-01-06 16:09) (1x <3): If I had any more testosterone I'd be roid raging
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:09) (1x <3): Someone has a not-so-subtle death wish
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:10) (2x <3): morality is the herd behavior of the individual
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:10) (1x <3): I think that you have stared for too long into the abyss
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:11) (1x <3): tis truly the gay science

Phillatio (2014-01-06 16:15) (1x <3): lol 
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:15) (1x <3): Never
Nate (2014-01-06 16:15) (1x <3): That's true.  Every female friend I've ever had I either wanted to fuck, did fuck, or was too ugly to fuck.  Only exceptions were girls I was friends with before I knew to like women
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:15) (1x <3): You would be asking people to operate on something other than their lizard brains
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:16) (1x <3): which is never gonna happen
Xander Xone (2014-01-06 16:16) (1x <3): Lizard brain says, "Befriend male chumps for possible benefits"
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:17) (1x <3): and they wonder why i won't committ
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:19) (1x <3): i identify their naivete and its like hiroshima all over again

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-06 16:35) (1x <3): my soul perished on that cold december evening as we sped down that turnpike

Xander Xone (2014-01-06 19:15): Mark Li is turning into a girl

Xander Xone (2014-01-07 01:19): Gonna start using some new super secret tech
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 01:20): In the early stages of the conversation, ask "Where's your boyfriend?"
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 01:20): If she has one, then you find out. If she doesn't, it makes her look lower value
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 01:23) (2x <3): Also, Phil is a secret fatty fucker
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 01:31): NOOOOOOO ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/1080x1920.png.3b2de8e059930131f67f22000a2d0e7b

Phillatio (2014-01-07 15:26) (2x <3): Level 4: Economic disengagement
Man who refuses to produce more than is strictly necessary for his individual survival. He will limit actions that are punished by taxation without jeopardizing his way of life and acceptable standard of living...

Xander Xone (2014-01-07 15:36): Not even dollar store prices
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 15:36) (1x <3): I think Phil might give them quail prices, though
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 15:36): you pay with your time
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 15:36): I'll pay to have you erased
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 15:37): the funds required for a job of that magnitude is multiples of your current net worth
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 15:38): That's okay, I'll do it myself on the cheap
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 15:38): you can certainly try

Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:03): It didn't seem to matter that the goofy blonde I hooked up with several weeks ago was taller than me
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:04): its only one factor, and each girl has different factor loadings
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:04): She must have been attracted to my being a raging douchebag
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:05): my guess would be a mean of 25% with a std deviation of 15% and a non-normal distribution skewed to the left

Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:06): Before I show you a REAL deviation

Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:09): Perhaps I should send her a ping text
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:10): why not
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:11): Done
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:11): I'm worried. What if she ballooned to 100lbs?
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:12): next
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:13): my personal rule: if her dress size is a positive integer, move on
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:13): I'm on permanent gap patrol
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-07 16:14) (1x <3): phil and i saw the finest gap in midtown yesterday
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 16:14): Don't forget the bikini bridge too
Phillatio (2014-01-07 16:17) (2x <3): "you go to women? Do not forget your whip!"

Phillatio (2014-01-07 18:42) (2x <3): I'm still gonna have gross sex with her
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 18:42): I won't allow it, not unless you wear protection for once
Xander Xone (2014-01-07 18:42): She's not worth impregnating
Phillatio (2014-01-07 18:42): Oh this time I need no convincing

Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:24): Apparently caloric intake matters
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:24): At least when it pertains to carbs
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:31): that reminds me, need to do some kettlebell swings today in preparation for this weekend
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:33): Yeah we do. I need to buy a kettlebell so I can leave my house even less
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:34): i havent played smash in a while, starting to develop a full body rash
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:34): How much can I buy a kettlebell for
Nate (2014-01-09 16:35): $40
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:35): This lesson is going to cost you one kettlebell
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:36): kettlebells at my gym max out at 60lbs, pretty lame
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:36): dont want to shell out $250/month for crossfit either
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:36): lol, you're not there yet
Nate (2014-01-09 16:36): I can't use kettlebells :(
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:36): you're not going to be doing huge sets of 60lb swings
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:36): i use kettlebells for upright rows, and 60 is way too light
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:37): but swings are going to kick my ass since ive never done em
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:38): Ah
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:38): I love kettlebell swings
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:38): 60lbs is a lot to be doing with swings
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 16:48): what else do you love
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 16:49): A good block of cheese
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:22): Mark, why don't you just use a barbell for your upright rows. I know that it takes an extra 30 seconds to put the weight on
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 17:27): wish i could, but the odd angle creates wrist problems when using barbells
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:27): just do a wide grip
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:28): and stop whining
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:29): shit, i don't wanna go to my date tonight
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:29) (1x <3): this always happens
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:31): i'm not gonna schedule any more tinder dates for after next week
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:31): I have 5 queued up between tonight and Wed
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:34): the other day my worst nightmare happened while benching
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:34): What have I done
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:34): pretty embarassing 
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:34): Time to switch to doing shoulder press
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:35): haha no 
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:35): I'll just do lower weights
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:35): I don't know my limits
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:36): Shoulder press is better
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:36): And dips
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:37): Esp when by yourself
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:38): meh
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 17:44): or just do whatever you want
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:52): yeah I mean
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:53): I think there's a lot of benefits to benching
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:53): it works a bunch of different muscles 
Phillatio (2014-01-09 17:53): if you do it correctly
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 18:59): lol shoulder press and bench press are not substitutes for one another
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-09 19:00): just get a spotter if youre gonna bench a lot
Jimmyayo (2014-01-09 19:03): Take the clamps off and let the weights slide off if u fail
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 19:40): I know they aren't, Mark
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 19:40): But if he's going solo

Xander Xone (2014-01-09 22:57): She was pretty cool but a few pounds more than I would have liked to bonk
Xander Xone (2014-01-09 23:02): I'm definitely not going on dates with any more ethnics thru tinder
Nate (2014-01-09 23:02) (1x <3): Why are ethnics fat by default?

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 12:03): Nate what do you mean by hard to get to

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 12:36): Its easy shit 2 years ago
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 12:37): Cant copy and paste it here it's too long. But looks fun. 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 12:40): I could probably do it in javascript
Phillatio (2014-01-10 12:42): http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ut6xc/employers_of_reddit_what_is_the_most_fucked_up/celn7n9
Phillatio (2014-01-10 12:42): damn son
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:04) (1x <3): so I'm continuing to gain weight from weight training
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:04): I'm up from 185 to 191 today 
Nate (2014-01-10 13:04): @Mark not the chick from last night?
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:05): I need to lose weight though. optimally I think my weight should be around 180 or less
TiMex (2014-01-10 13:09): Depends on how much muscle you want
TiMex (2014-01-10 13:10): We are similar size and I want to get up to 205
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:12): right. well I mean weight is not as important as body fat %. It's just weird that I gained like 6 pounds in the past few weeks
Nate (2014-01-10 13:13) (1x <3): Have you been eating blocks of cheese?
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:14): haha noooo 
Nate (2014-01-10 13:15): fyi muscle is heavier than fat too
Nate (2014-01-10 13:15): although putting on 6 lbs of muscle in 3 weeks is pretty insane
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:15): yeah I know that's why its a bit weird 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:16): I don't look any fatter 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:16): whatever the scale isn't that important
Nate (2014-01-10 13:16): Nope, the rock hard body that girls wanna lick is
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:20): Nick what's your thoughts on cardio 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:20): or Nate if you have any good insights 
Nate (2014-01-10 13:21) (1x <3): You want cardio, although if you're workouts are tough enough you'll get plenty of cardio
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:21): right I haven't been doing any
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:22): and I hate running
Nate (2014-01-10 13:22): Then you'll have lots of muscle and no stamina
Nate (2014-01-10 13:22): If you do your workouts without taking breaks you'll get plenty of cardio
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:23): yea
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:23): the Y I got to has a pool
Nate (2014-01-10 13:24): That's how I've been working out lately, only difference is I can't do much weight yet because of my injury, so I do lifts with 15-20 reps
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:24): gotcha
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:25): yeah I think that you can balance it out
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:25): by doing more reps and sets
Nate (2014-01-10 13:25): Well I don't have a choice :)  If I do more weight I fuck up my back
Nate (2014-01-10 13:26): You still doing crossfit?
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:26): I never started
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:26): too much money honestly
Nate (2014-01-10 13:27) (1x <3): Honestly there is too much risk of injury with the way they do things too
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:28): yeah well there's some hot debate about all of that
Nate (2014-01-10 13:28): Well when I did crossfit, half the people there, including my trainer were in various stages of recovery from injury
Nate (2014-01-10 13:29) (1x <3): The problem is a lot of those exercises shouldn't be done rushed, because it increases the chance of you doing something badly
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:30): yeah I need to join a sport
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:30): Work Intervals – Don’t make the mistake of doing hard cardio. Instead of pacing yourself, take complete breaks. Use a heart rate monitor to make sure you go hard enough to get into the “red zone”—85% of your maximum anaerobic threshold – and don’t start again until you’ve transitioned to the “green zone”— 0-75% of your max heart rate. Think of the “yellow zone”—76%- 84%—as a transitional zone. You might feel like you can go again in the yellow bu
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:31): Phil like I told u last Friday, try interval weight training 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:31): Keep ur heart rate high
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:31): well I like what I'm doing weight training wise
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:31): Its basically cardio 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:31): and it generally keeps my heart rate up
Nate (2014-01-10 13:31): Nothing wrong with hard cardio, but it depends on what you want in your results
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:31): I just need to tack on some sort of cardio
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:32): If u feel it's not high enough start with a 5 min run. 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:32): U can add a 5 min run to ur set tii
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:32): Too
Nate (2014-01-10 13:32) (1x <3): Or do sprints.  They are awesome.  Run flat out for 30 secs, take 2 min break, rinse repeat
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:33): I used to start my workout with a 5 min run, the do one set of weights and do a 90 sec sprint then do another set of weights and so on 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:34): No breaks 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:34): Breaks lower the heart rate
Nate (2014-01-10 13:34) (1x <3): weight training with very little break really gets the heart rate going
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:34): Keep ur heart rate high
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:34): right
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:34): Yup 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:34): I like that
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:34): I think I'm going to try to find a sport to do
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:35): like a soccer league 
Nate (2014-01-10 13:35): curling!
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:35): lolz
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 13:35): There is pick up soccer all over meetup. Com
Phillatio (2014-01-10 13:35): yeah I've seen it
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:16): I'm researching different sports to do
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:16): maybe capoeira
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:16): or brazilian jiu-jitsu
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:17): Do bjj
Nate (2014-01-10 14:18): He lives
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:19): Just woke up at Nichole's
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:19): capoeira is pretty 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:19): haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:19): Bjj is the shit. I took it for several months
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:20): + when I took mma
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:20): hmm
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:21): I'm thinking about getting back into it after I get another job
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:22): yeah I need a sport that will entertain me and give me a good cardio workout 
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:23): Lol, I used to weigh 180 when I was in ridiculous shape from crossfitting/power lifting
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:23): Now I'm 170lbs of bird shit
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:23): now I'm 191 pounds of pure power 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:23): and fat
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:24): I have a Michelin tire round my torso
Nate (2014-01-10 14:24): I guess your horniness outweighted your desire to hang :)
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:25): Wait, you got flaked on
Nate (2014-01-10 14:25): yeah she never contacted me at all.  That almost never happens
Nate (2014-01-10 14:27): I kinda knew it was gonna happen though.  I fucked up the texting really badly
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:27): fuck, I'm very conflicted
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:27): about what to pick up 
Nate (2014-01-10 14:28): pick up a vietnamese girl
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:28) (1x <3): sucky sucky
Nate (2014-01-10 14:29) (2x <3): @Xan I figured you'd text me when your date ended.  Just assumed you did something else when you didn't
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 14:30): 😈
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:33): Dayum
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:34): I think I'm relying too much on my harem members now
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:34): damn BJJ looks freaking dangerious
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:34) (1x <3): Between that and tinder, my desire to approach has been killed
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:34): @Phil It's really quite safe compared to most martial arts
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:36): hmm yea
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:36): well I'll just go with what's closer to my house
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:40): Lol
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:44): My date last night wasn't that great
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:44): They're always heavier until I hit a gem like Katie
Nate (2014-01-10 14:45): Did you make out, or just couldn't stomach it?
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:46): Didn't bother escalating. Wasn't into it
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:47): My new strategy if I don't like them is to jabber and not escalate until they get bored/frustrated and end the date
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:47): Basically run beta game
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 14:48): Run creepy beta game is faster
Nate (2014-01-10 14:48): My strategy when I don't like them is to escalate until they get uncomfortable
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:48) (3x <3): my strategy when I don't like them is to get up and leave
Phillatio (2014-01-10 14:48): saves time
Nate (2014-01-10 14:48): Lemon Law!
Nate (2014-01-10 14:48): It's a thing
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:48) (1x <3): That's because your standards are lower than mine Nate
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:49): I don't even like making out with meh girls any more
Nate (2014-01-10 14:49): Also because I see the girls before I go out with them, so I have a different reason to not like them
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:49): True
Nate (2014-01-10 14:50): Although my date monday may or may not be below my standards.  It was really hard to tell because of the thick ass coat
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:54): Crap, tonight is my only free night until Wednesday
Nate (2014-01-10 14:54): Tomorrow is my only free night right now
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:54): I already feel like flaking on everyone
Nate (2014-01-10 14:55): well until tuesday
Nate (2014-01-10 14:55): Gonna day game this weekend.  Time for more bitches
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:57): I'll join you
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 14:58): Actually, I should be hawking my wares in gaylife right now
Nate (2014-01-10 14:58): Sure
Nate (2014-01-10 14:59): After the RSD hot seat, my day game openers have gotten quite different
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:05): I'm really excited for Krauser's new day game book
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:05): How so Nate?
Nate (2014-01-10 15:05) (1x <3): I stopped giving girls most compliments and started saying whatever random shit I could think of in the 3 seconds before I approached them
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:06): So u stopped using that silly can opener
Nate (2014-01-10 15:06): Random observations about them.  Things that don't make sense.  Comments about their clothes/silly clothes
Nate (2014-01-10 15:06): yeah
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:06): *canned 
Nate (2014-01-10 15:07): Especially really beautiful women just aren't receptive to compliments about their beauty
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:07): Talk about their hair
Nate (2014-01-10 15:07): Unless they are ridiculous
Nate (2014-01-10 15:08) (2x <3): The random crap is working really well for me
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:08): Also more Krauser style
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:08): Awesome bro
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:08): Welcome to my world Nate
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:08) (1x <3): Nate it's not random.. Its ur own style
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:08): Its u
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:09): A stream of random bullshit constantly issuing forth from my mouth
Nate (2014-01-10 15:09): Well it's random in that I have no idea what I'm going to say ahead of time, I just say the first thing that comes in my head
Nate (2014-01-10 15:09): @Xander I still am not good at doing that in normal conversation
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:09) (1x <3): I was talking to this chick about rusty trombones and vegetarian hot lunches the other day
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 15:10): Meh. My conversation skill have been getting bad
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:11): Plus, always better to compliment a chick on something she can control (style, clothing, etc) than her looks
Nate (2014-01-10 15:11): I admit it's a lot more fun telling a girl I want to talk to her because her face expression is wierd
Nate (2014-01-10 15:12): Yeah I (and Mark apparently) need to practice stream of consciousness conversation
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:13): I can help you with that
Nate (2014-01-10 15:14): I'd be appreciative.  Right now my mid-game conversation is my undoing most of the time
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:15) (1x <3): Ahmad just needs to talk more in general
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:15) (1x <3): He gets stuck in his own head
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:24): Conversations should practically just be free association
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:25): She talks about cherries and then you talk about cherry coke mixed drinks
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:25): And then she talks about some experience she had with drinking
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 15:26): Then you talk about how you almost died recently from drinking too much
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:43): Well that's conversation threading 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:43): Hopefully your conversation will have a bit more substance 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:44): Just talk about what you're passionate about. Something you can talk about with your buddies for hours w/o getting tired cuz it interests you so much
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 15:44): Even if it's fucking smash brothers
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:27): Substance? It's irrelevant what you talk about as long as you're tickling her lizard brain
Nate (2014-01-10 16:28): define please: tickling her lizard brain
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:29): I hardly ever tell her anything about myself these days
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:29): At least not until after I bang het
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:30): Ahmad is getting tickets left and right lately. Just got a bullshit one for being "less than 4 feet from a hydrant"
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:30): Cars are such a liability in this area
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:31): @Nate I give her ambiguous answers to questions, ignore, etc
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:31): Steer the conversation into things that are about her feels
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 16:31): Get her talking about herself and then give her shit for things so that she's qualifying herself
Nate (2014-01-10 16:32) (1x <3): thanks
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 16:42): Turns out u have to be 15 feet from hydrant.. What a load a bs
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 16:42): *load of bs
Nate (2014-01-10 17:10): dance for me puppet!
TiMex (2014-01-10 17:10): I walked by a hydrant the other day with the street area marked off that you can't park in. It's about 3.5 steps
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:10) (1x <3): *dances frantically as bullets land all around his feet*
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:11): I'm going to dispute it 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:11): Also I got a red light ticket 2 days ago
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:11): Meh... 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:11): Ice on the ground I ain't breaking for anything or anyone
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:12) (1x <3): on his way to the red light district
Nate (2014-01-10 17:12): The judge is going to tell you that you should have been driving slower then...
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:12) (1x <3): I will show him my man boobs he will change his mind very quickly
Nate (2014-01-10 17:12): they always lower the ticket price anyway if you dispute it tho
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-10 17:14): We will see... These are my first two tickets in my life 
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:15): you gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:15): I've had many
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:43): After next week, I'm taking a good long tinder hiatus. Need to force myself back into day gaming. I have my harem to keep me satisfied if I experience a day game-related cold streak
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:44): I think I'm taking a hiatus in general 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:44): I need to get my internal affairs in order
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:45): Dude, are you secretly imploding
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:46): haha 
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:46): no
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:47): I feel pretty good
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 17:49): You're just checking out, I understand
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:53): I'm just not doubt online game anymore.
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:53): so I'll have to find dates elsewhere
Phillatio (2014-01-10 17:53): I'm going to stop forcing things
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 18:04): Lauren sealed the deal
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 18:08): Don't worry Phil, we're gonna tear up Willytown tonight
Phillatio (2014-01-10 18:27) (2x <3): Looking forward to it. I'm not worried though 😋
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 18:53): Where ru fellas headed?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 18:53) (1x <3): I'll be at pacha later, goal for the night is to finger one girl and make another suck my fingers
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 18:56): All the places. The levee, union pool, etc
Jimmyayo (2014-01-10 18:57): Don't forget your plaid shirts and plastic glasses
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 18:58): I left my plaid shirts behind in SF
Xander Xone (2014-01-10 19:05): I wonder when Ltd came back to GayLife
TiMex (2014-01-10 19:07): Over the holidays I think

Xander Xone (2014-01-12 20:46) (1x <3): Shameless self-promotion: I'm offering in-depth 1-on-1 coaching for your texting/tindering/okcupid needs. I'll teach you how to get a higher match and response rate by tweaking your profile and messages to target her lizard brain. PM for details
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 20:46): That's my pitch for GayLife
Phillatio (2014-01-12 21:16): Like
Phillatio (2014-01-12 21:16) (1x <3): Even if it is a bit douchebaggery
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 21:19): I just added more
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 21:19): My offer is that I will go through all of your texts/tinder/okcupid messages and critique what you have sent so far. I will explain the particulars of any errors that I detect and then the underlying theories. We'll craft example messages as well as actual messages for your current leads. I'll walk you through how to take a more  quantitative, high-throughput approach to text game in order to maximize your success.
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 21:19): Furthermore, we will go out in-field, and I will analyze your conversational abilities by winging you. I'm not going to waste your time with flashy showboating, but rather teach you how to get the type of girl that you're interested in, regardless of environment.
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 21:20): It seems that douchebaggery sells
Phillatio (2014-01-12 21:40) (1x <3): I like the above very comprehensive
Phillatio (2014-01-12 21:40): Lauren wants to fuck you btw
Phillatio (2014-01-12 21:41) (1x <3): Of course I think she would fuck anything
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 21:52): Thanks Phil. Just hammered it out on my phone at coffeeshop bar
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:14): I'm through with Lauren
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:14): So annoying
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:16) (1x <3): Insecure, ugly/fat and stupid is never good
Xander Xone (2014-01-12 23:17) (1x <3): "Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son"
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:18): I think the nail in the coffin was that I said she said giving head was gross
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:18): Wtf am I doing
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:18) (1x <3): Xander why didn't you slap me in the face

Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:19): Lol
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:21) (2x <3): Your mayorship is gone
Phillatio (2014-01-12 23:22) (2x <3): And I'm about to steal it from Ahmad
Phillatio (2014-01-13 10:04) (1x <3): A man goes to the doctor requesting birth control for his 10 year old daughter. The doctor, surprised, exclaims "Your daughter is ten and she is sexually active?!" He replies "I wouldn't call it active. She typically just lies there and cries."
Phillatio (2014-01-13 10:04): I enjoyed that
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-13 11:21): you would
Phillatio (2014-01-13 11:23): hehehe

Nate (2014-01-13 15:16) (1x <3): I probably wouldn't remember him if I did
Xander Xone (2014-01-13 15:16) (1x <3): I remember that Indian guy with glasses and long hair from 230 5th the night I met anchorman
Nate (2014-01-13 15:16) (1x <3): The random beta indians are all starting to blend together at meetups
Xander Xone (2014-01-13 15:17): I think his name was Alex
Phillatio (2014-01-13 15:22): Marvin is black
Phillatio (2014-01-13 15:22): he doesn't really look like his picture
Nate (2014-01-13 15:24) (1x <3): Unfortunately for him his parents named him Marvin
Jimmyayo (2014-01-13 16:08) (1x <3): Oh dude, that long haired Indian guy w/ the pony tail
Jimmyayo (2014-01-13 16:08): Lawls
Jimmyayo (2014-01-13 16:12): I vaguely remember looking at him and thinking he would smell really, really bad
Jimmyayo (2014-01-13 16:13) (1x <3): Anchorman seemed pretty legit tho, imo.  Decent, smart guy 
Phillatio (2014-01-13 16:14): anchorman is a solid chap
Jimmyayo (2014-01-13 16:31): That needs to be said while wearing a fedora
Xander Xone (2014-01-13 16:40): Anchorman is pretty legit. I went out with him one time several weeks ag
Xander Xone (2014-01-13 16:40): o

Xander Xone (2014-01-14 11:58) (1x <3): Ugh, Jad
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:11): I can't smoke anymore
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:11) (1x <3): Lol Phil, I know I've heard you say that a number of times
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:15): It's seriously gonna get me fired

Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:22): Holy smokes man, that's awesome.  Doing similar work?  Going to google would mean leaving finance no?
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:23): its within their finance dept
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:24): id be taking a pay cut though, so well see
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:24): I find that in general, EU jobs seem to pay less 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:25): But the work life balance is pretty incredible - 30 paid days off, tons of national holidays
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:25): right more perks

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:25): although i hate the dutch language, it sounds barbaric
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:25): It's cancer of the throat
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:25): I think it sounds cute
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:26): depends on the attractiveness of the girl saying it i suppose
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:26): ^
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:26): a hottie could be speaking in klingon and id get turned on
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:27): oh damn any attractive girl speaking klingon would give me an instaboner
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:27): and i dont even watch star trek
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:27): lol 
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:27): I told my boss I lost power in my house and my alarms didn't go off

Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:29): I love getting a bloody dick
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:29): i concur

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:30) (1x <3): i love teaching girls how to squirt
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:30): with specks of blod in it
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:30): yeah same although its hard to get some girls there
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:31) (1x <3): they have to be in tune with their bodies first
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 12:31) (2x <3): and some need to get over their insecurities 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:33): Me too man...something about watching them lose control and gushing like a waterfall 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:33): Maybe I watched too much jap porn when i was a teenager 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:34): I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'll lay a thick towel down on the bed first, can't be getting shit on my expensive duvet cover
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:38): nah I'd want to sleep in it
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:39): curl up with her juices
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:39): and inhale deeply
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:41) (1x <3): Jad is incredibly butthurt right now
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:41) (1x <3): He's PMing the shit out of me
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:41) (1x <3): Just because I prodded him a little in GayLife
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:41): He's sensitive 
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:41): Jad seems like a total little bitch
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:42): I'm not his fucking nanny
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:42): He sounds like a girl
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:43): Be the bigger man xandy. No need to make him cry 
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:43): lol no make him cry
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:43): I find it very amusing 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:44): I can't be bothered
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:44): He didn't like seeing the matrix, so now he's taking it out on me
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:45): Even though it was just a mere peek
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:47): hehehe short jokes are always good
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:48): I know you beg to differ Xandy 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:48): Why? I'm not short
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 12:48): HE'S NOT SHORT
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:48): oh
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:48): And I don't beg anyone for anything. I take it by force
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:49): I'm slightly turned on right now
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:49): I'm turned on by the tears of Jad right now
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:51) (1x <3): There must be something missing in my heart
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:52): don't look now
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:52): but its me
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:55): when can I look
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:57): when you see the four horsemen of the apocalypse 
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:57): I've been seeing them for ages
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 12:57): I think that they're cresting the horizon as we speak
Phillatio (2014-01-14 12:59): hehehe
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-01-14 13:07): Phillatio changed name to King Beta

King Beta (2014-01-14 16:09): now I'm definitely going to kill him
King Beta (2014-01-14 16:09) (1x <3): I might even torture him first 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 16:10): This guy is going to be trouble
King Beta (2014-01-14 16:10): some electrodes attached to his balls might chill him out
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 16:11): I haven't even caught a glimpse of him yet
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 16:11): The faggot
King Beta (2014-01-14 16:13) (1x <3): redpill as shit: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/franois-hollandes-affair-leads-to-poll-boost-thanks-to-support-from-french-women-9058650.html

Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:00): @Phil What in particular struck you about that post
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:01): mostly the hamster spinning, self rationalization she goes through just to get on that alpha cock
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:01): some girl calls her out and she's like "I know you're right. I'm just not entirely sure where my head is at."
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:01): lol
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:02): It's sad how little women understand themselves
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:02): and you know that no matter what girls say in that thread
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:02): she's still going to want to fuck him
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:03): It's all about how she feeeeels
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:20): I hate reading the "blue pill examples" on theredpill
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:20): its just boring, familiar and useless 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:21): Glad you realized that
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:25): well I've known for awhile
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:25): just felt like vocalizing it 
Nate (2014-01-14 18:26): only time I like them is when I relate to the alpha guys that the beta's are complaining about
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:28): mm 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:32): I'm gonna make a man out of you
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:35): its weird finding out how many men girls you're fucking have had sex with
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:35): I was marcelle's second
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:35): and she's 24
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:36): jesus
Nate (2014-01-14 18:36): Unless the number has 4 digits I don't care what her number is
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:36): unless it has 2 digits
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:36): for me
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:37): I would never ask or really want to know
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:37): but if I found out and it was in two digits
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:37): I would be less attracted to her
Nate (2014-01-14 18:37): because it's not enough or too much?
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:38): too much
Nate (2014-01-14 18:38): 10 is too much?  judgemental aren't we
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:39): yes
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:39): very judgmental if you haven't noticed 
Nate (2014-01-14 18:39): What was that?  I wasn't listening
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:40): hahah
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:41): #count second
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:42): add Manfred to our chat
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:42): but how
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:42): he's not in the other chat
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:43): hmm
Nate (2014-01-14 18:43): Who hosts Manfred?  I bet he records everything
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:43) (1x <3): Chicks with high notch counts aren't good ltr material
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:43): And there is a growing body of evidence bearing that out
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:43): Marcelle seems to think I'm at least 20
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:43): that must mean she's super into me
Nate (2014-01-14 18:44): @Xander true, but if I'm gonna marry I want one that will have threesomes
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:44): im #14 for this one girl
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:44): Why should you need to marry her, Nate
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:44): who thinks im at least on #50
Nate (2014-01-14 18:44): good point
Nate (2014-01-14 18:44): okay ltr
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:44): whats tlr
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:45): some kind of turtle
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:45): lol long term relationship
Nate (2014-01-14 18:45) (1x <3): more of a mongoose
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:45): squirtle squirt
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:45): but you're trolling
Nate (2014-01-14 18:45): bulbasaur
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:45) (1x <3): Jad showboating again
Nate (2014-01-14 18:45): vine whip baby
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:45) (1x <3): Jimmy, I'm glad that I was a dissenting voice in adding him to this chat
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:46): FOR THE RECORD
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:46): jad is gol 2.0
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:46): with extra blackness
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:46): He's white middle eastern
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:46): w/e
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:47): And I can't imagine GoL getting half as butthurt
Nate (2014-01-14 18:47): I've never seen gol get butthurt 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:47): maybew i should get coaching from jad
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:48): or maybe i should smoke this joint
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:49): I vote for the second one
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:49): hope you didnt smoke all the weed i left
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:49): because that was supposed to be us time bonding weed
Nate (2014-01-14 18:49): I vote you give me all your weed, option 3
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:50): uhh.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:50): :(
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:51): haha
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:51): there's still a bit left
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:51): in my pipe 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 18:51) (2x <3): you nigger lover
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:54): hehehe
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 18:57): I'm thinking about just washing my clothes in the bathtub
King Beta (2014-01-14 18:57) (1x <3): I've done that
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 19:03) (2x <3): someone tried to sell me steroids at the gym today
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 19:03) (1x <3): making progress
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 19:08): @Phil lol
King Beta (2014-01-14 19:08): What a bunch of shit
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-14 19:18): are you home phil
King Beta (2014-01-14 19:27): I am now
King Beta (2014-01-14 19:29): If you're coming text me when you're near by. I'm going to the gym but I'll come back when you get here
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:24): Fuck AB is a talker
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:24) (2x <3): And kind of a Debbie downer
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:24): Ugghhhhhh
King Beta (2014-01-14 21:28): He's a bit annoying in person
King Beta (2014-01-14 21:28): And on the chat
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:44) (2x <3): He just talks so much, and says a lot of stuff that I really don't want to hear, mostly negative stuff, excuses for not approaching, having really high standards, bla bla
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:45) (2x <3): And he seems to think very highly of himself as relates to game
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 21:51) (2x <3): Which is ironic given that he did 1 20-second approach in a span of 2 hours 
King Beta (2014-01-14 21:56): Yeah he blows
King Beta (2014-01-14 21:57): His day approach is way off
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:07): This shit is good.. ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/2448x3264.jpeg.115e67f05fc00131201622000a2d0ef6
Nate (2014-01-14 22:07): damn right it is
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:07) (2x <3): Too bad it's done ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/2448x3264.jpeg.1f1d9ea05fc00131f69222000a2d0e7b
Nate (2014-01-14 22:07): I have no tolerance for guys that make bullshit excuses
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:08): Cmon everybody makes excuses here and there 
Nate (2014-01-14 22:08): yes but if it's their default 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:09): Yes, but it is something that everybody does. Saying u have no tolerance for it is extreme
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:09): I can't approach bc all the girls in nyc are ugly
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:09): mad ugly
Nate (2014-01-14 22:10): @jimmy I'm annoyed at my date, so I'm taking it out on others right now
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:11): Whats going on nate
Nate (2014-01-14 22:12): I went by my place and said I was going to use the bathroom and she wouldn't even come up for 5 mins, and this was a third date.  Nevermind staying there.  Fuck her.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:12) (1x <3): Ouch sorry bro.  Please don't ever see her again 
Nate (2014-01-14 22:13) (1x <3): Not going to
Nate (2014-01-14 22:13) (1x <3): I got real cold with her and said that if she didn't trust me enough to come up for 5 minutes, then she didn't have the openness I was looking for
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:13): Interesting
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:14): I had a similar situ about 4-5 mo's ago
Nate (2014-01-14 22:14): During the date she asked me to describe...in detail... a sexual experience with me too
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:15): What was she
Nate (2014-01-14 22:15): black
Nate (2014-01-14 22:15): I was into her because she was a tv presenter and a model
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:15): Same chick u showed us 
Nate (2014-01-14 22:15): yeah
Nate (2014-01-14 22:16): I need some loose women.  Gonna game tomorrow+more 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:16) (1x <3): Yeah me and Xander have been sitting at home all day
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:17) (1x <3): Not even doing laundry 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:17) (1x <3): That needs to be done
Nate (2014-01-14 22:17): yesterday was worse.  she had a big cold and was coughing up a lung the whole time.  lasted 45 mins
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:17) (3x <3): Excuse.. Watching breaking bad
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:17): Nate, move on she isn't worth your time
Nate (2014-01-14 22:19) (1x <3): I am.  It's not hard for me to get numbers if I put any time into it
Nate (2014-01-14 22:21): Not even that annoyed, except lately I've had a decent number of dates, and a hard time sealing the deal
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:21): Realtalk for a sec, not trying to blow you up but:  Is it you or them?
Nate (2014-01-14 22:22): Excellent question, perfectly willing to say I'm not sure
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:22): and are you getting your knickers in a bundle simply because you're not fucking girls on your first date?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:23): Like, even if u dont fuck a girl on the first date, it's okay cuz often you'll fuck them on your 2nd or 3rd depending on her comfort/attraction level
Nate (2014-01-14 22:23): Only annoyed if I don't fuck em on the first date if I don't want a secon
Nate (2014-01-14 22:23): d
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:23): Oh lol
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:24): If I don't want a 2nd date, I wouldn't care to give her the satisfaction of sex
Nate (2014-01-14 22:24): If I don't kiss them at all on the first date though it doesn't bode well
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:24): Yah definitely
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:24): That's a red flag
Nate (2014-01-14 22:24): Had a few of those recently
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:25): I don't think I've ever had one of those turn into more than a 2nd date of frustration. 
Nate (2014-01-14 22:25): Willing to admit my game is worse than many folks here tho, so it's entirely possible others wouldn't have the same problem with the same girl
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:26): Hey Nate
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:26): And everybody else here
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:27): I just listened to Tony D's podcast regarding redpill
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:27): I must say, I've read a lot of redpill material
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:27): And dabbled in it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:27): I agree almost 100% with this podcast's stance on it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:27): I hope yall listen to it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:28): http://www.absoluteability.com/philosophy/manosphere-rant/
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:28): It's a good balanced look on it IMO
Nate (2014-01-14 22:29): @jimmy I still have an issue which I'm sure is holding me back that I don't push enough.  Girls rarely ever say they hate me, etc.  Still, patience I have
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:29): I'm a newb
Nate (2014-01-14 22:29): I'll take a listen
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:29) (1x <3): Xander now isn't trolling time buddy
Nate (2014-01-14 22:31): I used to get really angry when things didn't go well, but at this point I'm just analytical and indifferent
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:31): Yeah have a listen. as much as I agree, on a theoretical level, the majority of redpill, you just need to find what honestly gets you to your goal.
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:33): To come back to Jad, though, he's way too butthurt-prone for this chat
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:33): OK
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:33): I don't have time to babysit people's egos unless they're paying me
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:33): rant done
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:34): I agree that he's not a good candidate for a new member
Nate (2014-01-14 22:34): he has good game tho, although that's not a requirement to be here
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:34): Nate, you may take the floor
Nate (2014-01-14 22:35): What would I do with the floor?
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:35): Dovetail this into what you have been realizing lately about alphatude
Nate (2014-01-14 22:36) (1x <3): You mean getting butthurt is a sure sign of not being a real alpha?
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:36): More the converse statement, but yes
Nate (2014-01-14 22:37): In reality I've known that one a while
Nate (2014-01-14 22:38): The biggest thing I've realized recently is that I'm vastly better than I was, but I still have a long way to go to catch up to you guys, much less be better.  Kinda stabilizing to just accept it
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:40): cLosers is really about moving past the ABCs of game into deep theory. Not to mention all of the other important factors of becoming an attractive male, such as exercise, style, etc.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:41) (1x <3): Eh for a while cLosers was only about talking about eating strange fats/proteins and trolling on guys that wanted to talk about real pickup shit, 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:42): Oh, I forgot about lifestyle too
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:42): That falls under lifestyle
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:43): Real Pickup Shit, broz
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:43): Is that when you, like, record every single interaction when you go out sarging and then dissect it in detail every night and dutifully write up a field report?
Nate (2014-01-14 22:44) (1x <3): @jimmy I think the trolling was a direct result of certain members of the chat being unwilling to talk in anything but positive platitudes, and being unable to have frank discussions
Nate (2014-01-14 22:44): @Xan I'm beginning to record my interactions.  It can be helpful
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:45): I was being hyperbolic, of course. Recording is useful
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:45): Whatever the case, I was just hoping that when a guy wants to have a real talk about game, we'd be good enough to help him out.  Sure he's a bit more sugarcoated than others, but that's not a reason to be an asshole. 
Nate (2014-01-14 22:45): I know
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:45): Just when pickup becomes your main hobby, you turn into a weirdo
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:46): Alright, let's discuss some real pickup shit
Nate (2014-01-14 22:47): @jimmy I like having real talks about game.  If someone isn't willing to accept any criticism though during discussions without taking it personally, it's not a discussion, it's verbal bullshit
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:47): I think I was pretty neutral during most of the discussion
Nate (2014-01-14 22:48): I'm not talking about you jimmy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:48): There was just too much projecting on both sides is what i'm saying
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:49): Ahmad just went through all of my Tinder conversations and estimated that out of ~430 girls, 50+% responded to the opener "Apparently, tinder claims you think I'm cute. Is this true?"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:49): Aaaaaaaanyways, he's no longer here so it's a moot point
Nate (2014-01-14 22:49): indeed
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:49): Yes Xander good job that is a great Tinder opener
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:49): Aside from that opener being thoroughly ruined for anyone else who wants to use tinder, that's a decent hit rate
Nate (2014-01-14 22:50): I wouldn't mind more talk of game though, especially since I'm much weaker in it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:50): I don't do online dating so irrelevant to me (and most non-modelesque non-white guys)
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:50): Oh, poo poo
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:50): I'm about to retire from tinder since it allows me to be too much of a cave dweller
Nate (2014-01-14 22:52): My problem with game is I feel that most of the people in the gotham community who aren't super wierd are either way more advanced than me or way more beginner
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 22:52) (1x <3): I wouldn't mind Pippy returning. I'm imagining him off somewhere being sad all of the time. He just needs to know that when we're critiquing him, it's because we care and we're trying to make him better
Nate (2014-01-14 22:54): Personally I'd rather someone trash the fuck out of me if it meant I'd get better
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:54): I just matched with a guy that looks very similar to you jimmy.. So there is hope for you jimmy on tinder
Nate (2014-01-14 22:54): msg him Ahamad
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:54): Nate every guy has his sticking point, regardless of how "advanced" he might be.  And most likely, whatever your sticking poitns are, they've been overcome 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:54): Lol Mark do I look like I need Tinder 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 22:55): Already blocked.. Xander has been getting match with dudes all day
Nate (2014-01-14 22:55): Well if my sticking points were overcome they wouldn't be my sticking points ;)
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:55): So that's great for him
Nate (2014-01-14 22:55) (2x <3): yeah your dick is all he needs
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:55): But irrelevant right now 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:58): Xander you guys kinda ganged up on my buddy (one of my best friends fyi), albet sure he's maybe a little on the sensitive side, but that's really because he treats everybody as well as he can, trolled the shit out of him when he wanted to talk about real theory
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:59): And just didn't appreciate the realtalk that he had to offer 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 22:59): So that's really why he's not here, this has become more a breeding ground for circle jerking, bragging, and making fun of Gotham (and talking about cheese and poop)
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:01): Hmm, I think there is an element of truth to what you're saying, but definitely an exaggeration
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-14 23:01): First step into becoming a pua.. Is to not give a fuck. That means don't be sensitive - are you going to be butthurt Everytime a chick tells u to fuck off or that u look like a creep
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:01): small exaggeration, large element of truth IMO
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:02): And Mark, please PLEASE stop saying that your trolling and teasing members is supposed to be viewed as something that helps their game (Xander insinuates this a lot)
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:03): You're not girls that we're trying to game
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:03): You're MEN
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:04): I created this group to have a healthy community of guys that are elevated from Gotham's pussy ways, but also are not jerks to one another and can help each other out when they need
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:05): To say that trolling is a fundamental part of game is beyond gay 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:05): @Jimmyayo I'll be frank. I think you invited a few people in here who were more beginnerish. They weren't properly vetted. I grew weary of what felt like talking about such fundamental concepts. Perhaps I didn't handle my frustration in the best way
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:05): And I should have taken it up with you directly
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:06): It was never a requirement to "not be a beginner" to be here.  Just not be a social retard really, and be active pursuing women. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:06) (1x <3): Then it seems we have divergent visions
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:07): It's your group. You started it, so your vision should prevail
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:07): I'm sure that we all have areas in which we view ourselves as a "beginner", if we were to be 100% honest with ourselves Xander
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:07): Not to blow you up, but you seem / seemed to have a problem with daygame approaches
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:07): Something that is a cakewalk for Nate
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:07): Well sure, I'm a pretty poor flautist or unicycle rider
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:07): But we'd never give you shit about it, cuz we've all been there 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:08): I mean, just because your day game/online game/text game is weak doesn't mean that your overall game is weak
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:08): I never had a problem admitting that my day game is weak
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:08): But I'm not upset by that fact either
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:09): Then what was it about Pippy that made you upset and frustrated?  If I can ask candidly
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:09): He's been studying this shit for 2 years and did a 30day challenge, drowned in redpill material for a while, bla bla bla.  He's DEF not a beginner
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:09): He was very validation-seeking, not unlike Jad
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:10): Which was the red flag in Jad's case
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:10): Lol dude 99% of PUAs are validation seeking man
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:10): If anything, that's what I would hope this chat breeds out of people
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:10): Someone here told me, much like how girls dress hot and sexy to show off to girls more than guys - so too, do PUAs game hard to impress their peers, than to have sex
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:11): I mean, that would have definitely applied to me in high school, but that's why I was so unhappy then
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:11): I stopped giving a fuck in college when I realized that the world didn't give a shit about me
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:11): Nigga most people are validation seeking in some way or form.  You'll never get rid of it entirely.  But if that's something that causes a riff, you'll have nothing but riffs.  
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:12): Between you and your male cohorts.
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:12): I'm not saying that we aren't validation seeking in one way or another
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:12): It's like when it exceeds a certain threshold, it becomes very metrosexual
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:12): Which bothers u
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:13): That's what annoys and frustrates you, when another male is being metrosexual
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:13): One of many things
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:13): It's a code word for feminized
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:13): Whatever the case, we're all here because we want to better our lives
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:14): So when someone is looking for legit help or feedback
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:14): That much is true, I hope
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:14): Whether they're soemwhat feminized or not
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:14): It is incumbent on the more experienced ones to be helpful IMO, rather than berating
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:14): Since we've all been in those shoes at one point
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:14): My point is, becoming less feminized and more masculine can only help attraction
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:15): Yes but your style of advice isn't helping them achieve that
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:15): And I never saw our ribbing as anything malicious
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:15): In regard to Pippy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:16): How you think you're giving it, and how it is perceived, is completely different.  And the intentions of the giver are for the large part irrelevant if he doesn't think about the latter. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:16): Look man
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:16): I know ur a decent guy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:16): But you can be an asshole in the chat
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:17): Nobody likes an asshole
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:17): Unless they're fucking it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:18): (Sorry for everybody else here witnessing the 1 on 1 between me and Xander)
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:18) (1x <3): What's to apologize for
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:19): We're talking like adults
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:19): I think some of this comes down to the diference between our worldviews, since ur so redpill and i'm not
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:19): @Jimmyayo And part of that may be that I've experienced more fucked up shit in my life, unfortunately
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:19): In certain arenas
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): That may be true; I've met tons of guys and I've come to appreciate that I've had a fairly decent life till now
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): But 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): Yes red pill theory maybe scientifically sound
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): But who cares
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): What's going to make you happy?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:21): What's going to make you successful?
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:22): I'm pretty happy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:22): That sounds like more of an attitude than an objectivist look 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:22): although I can't say whether ur truly happy or not 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:23): But most guys that are deep in red pill don't seem happy at all
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:23): They are once they come out the other side
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:23): Bitterness is one phase of it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:23): And it seems to fuck up a lot of guys 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:25): The conversation is digressing into a philosophical one about worldviews, which i don't have a very strong opinion of TBH
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:25): My whole point is
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:25): I want a playground where we can play nice
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:25): Where we can talk real theory and have helpful discussions, and not be gaytards like most of Gotham
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:26): But also not trolled heavily when we want real advice
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:26): If this is too much to ask (and I've been feeling that it is, for the last few months)
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:26): Then what the fuck is the point of this group anyway???
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:28): It seems to be serving SOME purpose, since people still bother posting here
Nate (2014-01-14 23:29): I honestly don't think people were ever trolled when they asked real questions
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:29): Also, "real theory" would necessarily include discussion of red pill theory along with every other kind of theory
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:30): Yeah...what that purpose is, i have no clue.  But it most certainly isn't helpful discussion regarding what will help me #closing a girl and then fucking her tmrw
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:31): This chat has become so much more noise rather than useful shit 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:31): I think that many people in here have been somewhat off the grid lately. Seems pretty normal for the depths of winter
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:31): And I'm not pointing fingers on any one person; I know that I'm largely to blame for the makeup of the chat to begin with 
Nate (2014-01-14 23:31): @jimmy I don't think you've really spent much time trying to discuss real theory either
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:32): No because I do tons of theory talking between Pippy and me in private chat, Nate
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:32): We wanted it here but it seemed very unwelcome 
Nate (2014-01-14 23:32) (1x <3): Well I do the same thing
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:32): I don't necessarily have tons of time to be talking about theory in general
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:33): I'm already dicking around a ton in the main chat
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:33): Basically distracting myself from important shit that I should be doing
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:33): Nobody's begging you to spew theory
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:33): But if you have nothing good to add to folks talking abut real shit, don't troll them
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:34): Anyways I've done enough ranting here
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:34): Like Nate said, I do talk shop plenty with people in private
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:34): I'm always willing to discuss shit if anyone messages me
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:35): Good for you.  God forbid you do add value in a group chat when people seek it. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:35): Even if they seem needy, beta, validation seeking. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:35): Well, GothamLife is something different altogether. Most of that info is falling on deaf ears
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:36): But I suppose I could contribute more in here, if that's really how you feel
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:37): Xander, you trolled the shit out of one of my best buds man
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:37): Yes, you said that
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:37): Except now you're not adding on "kinda"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:37): So I probably couldn't care less at this point what happens to Closers - since nobody seems to do many cold approaches around here anyways besides me and Natre
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:38): It's just that he was a genuine felllow that really wanted to add value and also seek good advice
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:38): And he was given a lot of shit for it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:38): From guys that aren't really all that great with pickup themselves, IMO
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:39): (pls dont take offense to that last part, it's an observation more than anything)
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:39): Well, if you feel like spending $1000/week, perhaps you could get top tier advice
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:39): In any case, I don't see why you just disband this group if you're so down on it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:39): Or you can expect advice from a bro that wants to help
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:39): Or at the very least ask the toxic members (me) to leave
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:40): Lol
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:40): Xander, you're good buds w/ everybody here...and since you're an alpha and charismatic they follow your patterns
Nate (2014-01-14 23:40): I do kinda wish there was someone that wanted to analyze their game like Krauser and his guys seem to.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:41): Closers is Xander, and Xander is Closers 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:41): As much as I formed it, I have very little control or sway here
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:42): This is your group.  And I'm not a fan of the energy that redpill exudes. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:42): Nate then you need people who aren't dogmatic and say "never use a smiley you beta fag" - Krauser uses smileys quite often 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:43): Yes, and his text game is arguably not that great, as he himself has admitted
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:43): He's a day game monster
Nate (2014-01-14 23:44) (1x <3): I haven't met anyone yet in gotham who fits that.  Everyone is either so full of themselves that they don't seem to have any humility, or are complete social idiots
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:44): If anything Pippy and I have always been super analytical in our textgame, daygame, and nightgame - even differentiating between bars, lounges, clubs, and festivals 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:44): It's not about any one instance of doing something like "sending a smiley face" or "using exclamation marks". It's about the overall effect. They're more guidelines than anything else
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:45): Also it's much easier to criticize what a guy did wrong, than advise on what he should do next 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:46): Almost every redpill PUA is more than happy to tell you why things didn't work out and why you sucked
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:46): But when it's time for proactive thing that'll help u get laid, there's 100 different things that seem to contradict one another
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:46): a
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:47): Not really. It's just probabilistic
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:47): And tailored to the medium
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:47): Every theory is probabalistic obvously
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:47) (1x <3): Texting a young, inexperienced chick of a certain ethnicity? You're gonna tailor to that
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:48) (1x <3): Opening an older broad in a deli? You're gonna tailor to that
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:48): It's more improvisational than having a line ready for every situation
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:48): But it's still following certain guidelines
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:49): All great theory but it's just not enough
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:50) (1x <3): It's not enough to help the average guy sort out how to talk to a girl when he hasn't done a single approach yet; when he hasn't had a succesful date yet; when he is getting numbers but no sex, and isn't sure why
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:51): Redpill is fine and dandy but one must take a look at that whole body of knowledge and ask himself how it's going to help him in his goals
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:53): A lot of guys (me here) don't need a revamp on male/female dynamics and mens rights. We just want a way to maintain our healthy way of life while getting more dates and more sex to compliment it. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:53): Game isn't really my concern at the moment. Getting some kind of worthwhile job again, getting my debt eliminated, having economic freedom, these things are currently taking precedence. Womanizing is pretty much the only thing that I'm not having problems with at the moment
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:53): You have the inverse of almost every PUA I know lol
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:54): Sorry to gloat, but I think I'm the only pua that I know, that is happy w/ family, job, women, hobbies. Maybe TiMex too. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:54): So you can perhaps understand my feelings then when some guy who is making a steady paycheck and whatnot is bitching and moaning about girlzzz
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:55): Some guy who hasn't moved 5 times in 7 months
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:55): After having moved across the country with not much more than a suitcase
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:56): I'm not even complaining, it just is what it is
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:56): Okay
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:57): Just don't screw others' minds in your own journey to finding where you need/want to be; I feel like that is definitely happening 
Xander Xone (2014-01-14 23:57): My focus isn't really on the nuances of game at this juncture, especially when I'm already managing to consistently bang hot chicks despite my circumstances
Nate (2014-01-14 23:58): Contrastly, mine is because I can't bang hot chicks consistently at all
Jimmyayo (2014-01-14 23:59): I'm not sure what "hot" means to you Nate, but if u you mean 8+ - unless you're an MPUA nobody bangs those on a consistent basis 
Nate (2014-01-14 23:59): okay replace hot with any
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:00): Suitably attractive. No one below a 6.5
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:00): Anyway, I encourage you to bring back Pippy to the chat if you ever feel like it
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:01): I promise I'll give actionable feedback with a minimum of snark
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:01): Thanks Xander
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:01): I think he'll come back when he feels like it will net positive for him rather than negative
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:02): He and I are working on a body of work specifically for EDM shows and concerts ATM
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:02): When his three SSRIs kick in, you mean
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:02): ;-)
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:02): jk
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:02): That actually sounds pretty cool
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:03): I'm not that big a fan of that sort of venue personally, but you should explore your passion
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:03) (1x <3): I think Ahmad would appreciate it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:04): I'm an adrenaline pussy junkie, going to webster hall and pacha once/twice a week for a month has been ridiculous 
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:05): You're definitely more on the extrovert side of the spectrum, so that makes sense
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:05): Extroverted yes
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:06): But also coming from a lifetime of being beta and people-pleasing 
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:06): I come more from the outsider/loner side
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:06): Feeling alienated from society
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:07): You're the dark stranger, I know. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:07): Like Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:07): What works for you prob won't work with a lot of other people though 
King Beta (2014-01-15 00:08): Hehe
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:08): Most people can't frolic in the darkness, this I understand
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:08): "Successful people learn theories for all people, then filter to what will help them specifically achieve their goals"
King Beta (2014-01-15 00:09): Adaptability
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:09) (1x <3): Xander, please have a listen to this podcast if you get a chance, I'd like to hear your thoughts on it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:09): http://www.absoluteability.com/philosophy/manosphere-rant/
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:09): No pressure
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:09): I was planning on it
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:10): I have made peace with the darkness, but it's certainly not for everyone
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:10) (1x <3): Also, I heard that the Christian McQueen podcast is really good
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:11): I'm not quite sure of the content, but Christian McQueen is more targeted toward your sort of game, Jimmy
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:11): Promoters, clubs, etc.
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:11): https://soundcloud.com/thechristianmcqueenshow
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:11): Awesome, I'll have a listen th
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:12): thx
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:13) (1x <3): My clubgame gets better every time I go out to a club with the goal of 1) having fun and 2) pushing sexual limits with girls
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:13): But I'll def have a listen
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:13): Seems like they're talking about more than just club game, like general pickup theory
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:13): From a glance at the episode titles
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:14): Nowadays I'm a lot more interested in material relating to maintaining multiple healthy open-relationships 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:14) (2x <3): And curbing alcoholism ;)
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:16): Now there's a subject not to be taken lightly
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:17): If I may be so bold, red pill related sites have really good material concerning maintaining relationships
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:17): I was telling Jad earlier today that most of the pickup material out there is about perfecting the approach and first bang
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:17): And it's pretty good for that
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:17): But then there is a huge drop-off
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:18): Yeah because after the initial seduction, there's just YOU
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:19): that's why most PUAs can't keep girls 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:20): After all that shit you learned to get the girl to fuck you....
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:20): What's left?  Who are you beyond that?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:21): The REAL you will come out, with all its insecurities
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:21): Mostly awesome
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:21): In my not-so-humble opinion
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:21): Haha
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:21): Your confidence is awe-inspiring, Xander 
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:25): �
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:26) (1x <3): I'm kind of an informal coach/evangelist for gotham. As sad as most of their games are, I truly want to seem them all succeed
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:27): I just wanted a separate medium to have an elevated chat 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:28): Without a need for trolling (though that's bound to happen from time to time)
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:28): Or painting anyone as beta
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:28): or talking down to anyone 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 00:30) (1x <3): If i'm unrealistic in my goals, please let me know
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:34): Here's my Thursday date:
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:34): http://portfolio.alilevinedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rachel-Mullins-photos-03.jpg
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:34): Just kidding!
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:35): This is my actual Thursday ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/1080x1920.png.ccfe96305fd401313ba922000a2d023c

Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:37): Looks pretty interesting. Uma Thurman

Xander Xone (2014-01-15 00:55): See Jimmy, boring
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 01:05): If you want me to analyze my boring text game in depth, I would be glad to
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 09:55): Ben M: Anyone interested in a free text game seminar??
Nate (2014-01-15 10:20): Ben's text game is really good.  I don't understand how his brain comes up with the stuff to say, but it works
King Beta (2014-01-15 10:40): We talkin' Ben as in Ben&charley
Nate (2014-01-15 10:43): No Ben as in Gol's brother
King Beta (2014-01-15 10:54): ahh
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 10:55): Morning cheese dicks!
King Beta (2014-01-15 10:59) (1x <3): morning cheeeeese
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:07) (1x <3): GOL why you being stupid
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:12): literally everything he says annoys the fuck out of me
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:13): seriously I want to slit his tiny little throat the short bitch
Nate (2014-01-15 11:15): You have issues
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:17): sure I do
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:17): he does infuriate me
Nate (2014-01-15 11:18): I have no idea why.  Nothing I've seen him said is that infuriating, or especially interesting today
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:18) (1x <3): I just find him annoying 
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:19): its not about what he says its about how he says it
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:19): and why he says it
Nate (2014-01-15 11:21): You mean to stroke his ego.  That's pretty much everyone here too
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:23): not really
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:23): we all have our moments of course 
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:23): but the connotation is that we consider each other equals 
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:24): I get a strong sense of superiority at all times from GOL
Nate (2014-01-15 11:26): When I talk to him in pm I don't get that.  Especially if he doesn't feel he knows something.  Guess part of it is I don't really care if people think highly of themselves
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:26) (1x <3): Ever hear of "short man complex"?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:27): Yeah a lot of my buddies have that tbh, it doesn't bother me too much either
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:27): It's like, let him have his 15 min of masturbation as long as he doesn't jizz on me i'm okay w/ it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:28) (1x <3): But remember last yr when Ben was going off "Hey great job w/ that text/approach/whatever, I'm SOOOOO proud of you!!!"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:28) (1x <3): Goddam that pissed me off
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:29): That being said, nothing brings people together better than hatred for a common enemy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 11:29): So yah let's trash them 
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:30): lolz
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:30): its not about what going on now its the combination of everything he's said
Nate (2014-01-15 11:30) (1x <3): I have to care enough about someone to be bothered by them
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:31): and now everything bothers me that he says
King Beta (2014-01-15 11:31): if it bothered me too much I would leave gay life
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 12:19): I remember that Ben shit last year, Jimmy
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 12:20): All of the disingenuous praise. So annying
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 12:58): Lol, Katie had to dress as Princess Peach for work today ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/882x1080.jpeg.87f9bce0603c0131d1c422000a2d0abb

Xander Xone (2014-01-15 13:47) (1x <3): My bed arrived
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 13:48): Commence the being able to maybe occasionally pull chicks back to my place
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 13:49): Rather than going to their place 100% of the time
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 14:19): @Jimmy Inverse PUA problems
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:28) (2x <3): now you just got to get that homeless guy out of your house
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:40): fuck 
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:41): well I can't get out of paying the towing company
Nate (2014-01-15 14:41): report your car stolen ;)
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:41): apparently they go after you in civil court  
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:41): yeah a little late for that 
Nate (2014-01-15 14:42): Go on craigslist.  Post an ad "Free car.  Needs repairs"
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:42): right, well. I'm not worried about getting rid of it
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:43): they'll take it off my hands
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:43): its the money
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:43): its always about the money
Nate (2014-01-15 14:43): if someone else owns it, then you don't need to worry about towing it anywhere
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:43): ah yeah but it was already towed and has been sitting in a lot
Nate (2014-01-15 14:43): oh
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:43): stacking up costs
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:44): yea so you see my problem  
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 14:49): Are you fucked
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:49): nahh
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:50): I have enough money
King Beta (2014-01-15 14:50): luckily 
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 14:53): Here's some real shit: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1v7sdz/women_never_suck_dick_in_their_stories/

Xander Xone (2014-01-15 15:15): Wheeeeeee!

King Beta (2014-01-15 15:16): to calm my mind
Nate (2014-01-15 15:17): Plus you have this wonderful car which you can trash as much as you want
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:17): haha well I'm giving it to them
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:18): they said its worth about 100 dolalrs
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:18): which I won't see any of
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 15:18): What would have happened if you had paid way sooner
Nate (2014-01-15 15:18): If you won't see any of it, go to the lot with a sledge and trash that fucker
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:18): I would have paid way less @Xander 
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:19): I was just being a lazy fucking idiot as usual
King Beta (2014-01-15 15:19): @Nate sounds like a party I would need to be drunk for
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 15:21): I haven't had any alcohol since Sunday
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 15:23): Last night when I got on my soap box, I was heavily dosed with muscle relaxants and scotch
Nate (2014-01-15 15:24): I haven't had any alchohol since last night
Jimmyayo (2014-01-15 15:24) (1x <3): Congrats

Nate (2014-01-15 15:28): I'm never gonna see that girl again
Nate (2014-01-15 15:28) (1x <3): Unless she invites me to a modeling gig or some other place I can bang other chicks from...
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 15:34) (1x <3): Everyone in here should probably be drinking a lot less
Xander Xone (2014-01-15 15:35): I permit you to use her as a wingwoman, nothing more
Nate (2014-01-15 15:36): that's the plan.  she's friendzoned.

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:43): She obviously wants me to pull some dumb chasing her shit, otherwise she wouldn't have asked to add me on foursquare and be pinging me all the time
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:44): It was fun putting her on the spot with her friend there
Nate (2014-01-16 10:46): What did you say to her?
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:46) (1x <3): "Hey, imagine seeing you here!"

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:48): She already knew I had checked in at the nearby laundromat a little earlier... And probably that I was in the same bar since Phil had already checked me in and she didn't act very surprised
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:51) (1x <3): So she was stalking me too. GUYZ
King Beta (2014-01-16 10:51): my god ecstatic is such a child
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 10:53): Why does he sound like such a blubbering baby. I thought he was a maaaaaster
Nate (2014-01-16 10:54): I said he was a great texter.  He's also 19, and has that maturity level...

Nate (2014-01-16 12:05): I'm trying to decide if I should use tinder.  One the one hand easy.  On the other my game needs a ton of work and I'm not sure if tinder will help that at all
Nate (2014-01-16 12:05): I was upselling Xander, slightly more subtly :)
Nate (2014-01-16 12:12): the one you texted but never went out with because you're flakey
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 12:14): Well shit, I'm not gonna remember her since there are a bunch of those
Nate (2014-01-16 12:15): She was a brunette, 19, and fucking gorgeous
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 12:16): Are you sure that I ever had a date set up with her?
Nate (2014-01-16 12:16): No you never set up a date
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 12:16): Then nothing was ever even set
Nate (2014-01-16 12:17): That was by your choice tho
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 12:17): RAAAAHhHHHHH
Nate (2014-01-16 12:17): My point was only that some non-hipster women were banging *cough* at your door too

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 14:19): buttercup creek
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 14:28): That's what I call 12y/o butthole
Nate (2014-01-16 14:57): > #14. Real G'S are silent like lasagna
Nate (2014-01-16 14:57): wtf does that even mean
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:09): Who knows
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:22) (1x <3): http://xkcd.com/1227/
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:24) (1x <3): If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You’ll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:30): @Alpha I want to read that book
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:32) (1x <3): http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591846919/
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:32): story of my life

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:34): @Alpha Have you read it or just that synopsis
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:36): reading it now
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:38): Electronic version
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:39): http://www.theattractionforums.com/general-discussion/96418-man.html
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:39): dope
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:39) (1x <3): i have epub if you want
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:39): A woman wants to fuck someone who's hard to get, she wants to BE with a nice guy though, it just takes women a few years to realise the difference.
So women want to fuck the disinterested alpha with many options until she hits the wall ("it took me a few years but i realized I actually want you, mr.nice guy with sizeable income and job stability!")
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:40): in other words, alpha fucks beta bucks
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:41): I want
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:41): have you read tomasi phil
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:41): He has read the iron rules

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:42): are you familiar with the alpha fucks beta bucks phrase
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:42): everything of substance*
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:42): yes
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:43): Alpha plays beta pays
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:44): http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/modafinil-2013-4/
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:44): But you don't like it
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:44): my roomie and best buddy Pete is profiled in it
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:45): oh shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:45): I'm glad you two have become so close
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:45): i love him, cant you tell
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:45): its all BS though
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:45): he doesnt even work in finance
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:46): lol, "He's into acupuncture and alternative medicine"
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:46): I stopped reading after that
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:47): he basically told the journalist what he wanted to hear
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:47): A true sociopath
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:48): i have much to learn
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:48): This whole sociopath thing is beginning to bore me
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:50): wow that article really makes me want to try modafinil 
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:51): oh ever see that movie limitless
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:51): r/nootropics made me want to
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:51): kind of a low quality movie but pretty interesting
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:53): you an probably reach the same level of awareness and concentration by years of meditation 
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:53): of course this is a super short cut
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:53): I'm a fan of shortcuts
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:54): haha I am too. this one seems too good to be true
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:54): Not addictive too
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:55): Dave Asprey, the bulletproof executive guy, is completely full of shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:55): by the way
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:55): its highly addictive psychologically
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:55): anything that makes you perform better is addictive
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:55): That's what she said
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:56): "Then he ran into an even bigger problem: Skip a dose, and there would be hell to pay. “I really would feel it. It was sort of like being thrust into dirty, messy reality, as opposed to a clean, neatly organized place."
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:56): im gonna get some from my doc to see what the fuss is all about
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:56): yeah see that's what freaks me out
King Beta (2014-01-16 15:56): I wouldn't mind doing it every once and awhile 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:56): especially for your narcolepsy 
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:57) (1x <3): I'm sure that's mostly pot induced
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:58) (1x <3): thats not what his manager believes
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 15:59) (1x <3): Regardless, I'm sure his manager isn't happy
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 15:59): gotta keep em guessing
King Beta (2014-01-16 16:00): all true
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 16:00): consistency and routine kill attraction
King Beta (2014-01-16 16:00): oh I don't think I'll ever be that consistent or routine like
King Beta (2014-01-16 16:00): but a bit of that would do me good
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:08): Heh heh heh heh heh

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:19): My date is at Keybar tonight. Who wants to lurk
King Beta (2014-01-16 16:26): I'll be the one breathing in your ear
Jimmyayo (2014-01-16 16:26): I call left ear
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:28): Now, now, children. There is plenty of Xandy to go around
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:33): lol, "Marcelle saw my list of bitches"
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:33): That just popped into my head for some reason
King Beta (2014-01-16 16:33): that.. was hilarious 
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:36): I think I recalled it because I was imagining Katie discovering my list
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:37): Speaking of which, it's time to update that list
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 16:55): Have fun with Jad, Jimmy.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-16 16:56): Should be fine, he's alright in my book
Jimmyayo (2014-01-16 16:56): Approaches like a beast

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 17:07): Hehehe
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:08) (1x <3): this is actually great cause they stop harassing me 
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:08) (1x <3): and can harass you instead
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 17:35): Stop hiding Andres from me, Jimmy. I will find him.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-16 17:38): Haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 17:57): I just cracked guys
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:58): just?
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 17:59): My game is imploding like a large star
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:59): the question is 
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:59) (1x <3): will it become a neutron star
King Beta (2014-01-16 17:59) (1x <3): or a black motherfucking hole 
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:02) (1x <3): Dana (00:44): "Hi sorry about that"
Me (17:50): "Hi mayor Dana"
Dana (17:54): "Mayor of what"
Me (17:57): "Lamesville"
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:03) (1x <3): Oh no...
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:06): She responded ".."
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:06): you got that right
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:06): oh no...
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:07): I guess punishing me for when I sent her an ellipsis months ago
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:07): Hehe
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:07): jesus, what is she german
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:07): hoe knows how to hold a grudge
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:07): I want to write "If you're gonna keep playing this hard-to-get, you should invest in some cats"
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:08): haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:08): I'm seriously considering sending that just to see the response
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:10): Thoughts gentlefolk
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:10): nah
King Beta (2014-01-16 18:11): not if you care about her happiness 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 18:11) (1x <3): that will only call attention to the fact that she is crushing you game wise
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:11): Heh heh
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:12): There is interest still on her part, but whatever
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:14): You are correct, Mark. My game pales in comparison to hers.
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:20): The brain works in silly ways. It's mostly irrational.
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:23): I have girls on the reg who adore me and I still want to move toward a will-o-the-wisp 
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:25): In general, I've noticed that the attractive girls who I can get Tinder dates with hover around 27
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:25): It's like the Wall made manifest
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-16 18:29): all that means is that, to you, danas value is higher relative to tinder sluts
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:30): Her value is higher, though. She isn't the kind of chick who jumps into bed with guys on the first or second date
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:31): She may be pricing herself out of the market, but whatever
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:36): I'm a faf
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 18:36): fag

Xander Xone (2014-01-16 19:43): My notetaking from earlier is spotty, so there are definitely dates that have fallen through the cracks. Also, this was first dates, I didn't include any subsequent ones
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 19:44): I'm probably gonna go back through and analyze the bangs later
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 19:45): You'll notice that there's a disgusting trend if you look at where I met them. I know what it's time to do.
Xander Xone (2014-01-16 19:46): Tinder shall be DELETED. Not just uninstalled.

Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 12:35) (1x <3): It's a good reminder that compared to a lot of people I'm really fucking normal
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:36): lol ^
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 12:36): This is probably the best venue we've held a meetup at
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:36): yeah I like the standard
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:37): generally
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:37): plus we can go to brass monkey afterwards
Nate (2014-01-17 12:37) (1x <3): I remember the last one Jad and I were gaming in 13 step and some guy from the meetup neither of us recognized or knew the name of followed us around awkwardly until we left
Nate (2014-01-17 12:37): even though we basically ignored him completely
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:38): freaky
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 12:39): I don't like the biergarten for pickup, but it's a fun place to chill and pregame
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 12:40): Really should hit up some clubs, haven't been to a nice club in ages
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:43): I'm quitting cigarettes 
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:44): I think its effecting my workouts 
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:44): and I certainly can't have that
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:47): Last night was interesting
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:48): I have a confession to make. I had a cigarette last night. I'm not proud of my actions
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:49): haha 
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:49): But in my drunken haze, I had no other way to figure out how to separate this chick from her friends other than to tell her to come have a cig outside with me
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:51): Well, it worked
King Beta (2014-01-17 12:52): heheh
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:54): Jad and I had a brief heart-to-heart as well
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:56): Ahmad had some swiss girl he was making out with
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 12:56): I had my canuck
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:01): anoiceee!
Nate (2014-01-17 13:02): fclose?
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:03): Nope. I ended up getting cockblocked by her fat friend, since it was her birthday
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:03): gross
Nate (2014-01-17 13:03): eww
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:04): At the same time, the fat friend kept DHVing the shit out of me, saying things like "I really like this guy. You should give him a shot"
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:04): Or some bull like that
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:04): "He's really cute" blah blah blah
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:04): This time I remembered to get her number, like a not complete idiot
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:06): My James Bond style game was completely on point by the time I opened her last night
Nate (2014-01-17 13:06): James Bond style game?
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:06): Walked up, tapped her on the back, said "Hi" with a smirk and stared
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:07): Long silences between my lines, building tension
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:08) (1x <3): I think I had about 3 second pauses between everything I said
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:09): She was completely enthralled. I was forcing her to react
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:09): like
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:12) (1x <3): I'm giving out complimentary handjobs tonight to everyone at the meetup, so be there or be square
Nate (2014-01-17 13:12): don't forget he ordered watered down martinis
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:12): I ordered a can of bud
Nate (2014-01-17 13:12): so basically the same thing
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:13) (1x <3): Low energy laconic style game
Nate (2014-01-17 13:13): I lost all respect for you when you said the word 'bud'
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:13) (1x <3): That fits you to the T 
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:13): My specialty
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:14) (1x <3): The 4 types of game:

1) passive, laconic (low-energy, beta, unattractive)
2) pro-active, laconic (low-energy, alpha, attractive)
3) passive, verbose (high-energy, beta, unattractive)
4) pro-active, verbose (high-energy, alpha, attractive)
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:14): I can go high energy, but it's pretty exhausting
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:14): Since I'm biologically a sprinter
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:14): yeah I'm more high energy 
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-01-17 13:15) (1x <3): Mark (Ahmad) changed the topic to: murders and executions
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:15): I don't have the endurance for sustaining high energy
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:16): on a related note

Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:23) (1x <3): How to work the James Bond style laconic game 
King Beta (2014-01-17 13:29): ah I read that
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:35): It's well written
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:35) (1x <3): "The problem with being laconic is that your sub-communications better be tight as FUCK, because you’re not giving her anything else to judge you on. You’d better be locking laser eye-contact, staring into her fucking soul. Your body-language better be chill and non-fidgety, unafraid to grab her and pull her in and position her how and where you want her while you talk, with rock-solid belief that she’ll follow."
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:42): Thanks Jimmy
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 13:43): I've read through that whole thing already, but always good to return

Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 13:55): Ooooh hard to resist I know
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 14:56): Someone is trying pretty hard to AMOG you, Jimmy.
Nate (2014-01-17 14:56): and doing a really pathetic job of it
King Beta (2014-01-17 14:56): its way less effective when he's 12 
King Beta (2014-01-17 14:56): and tiny
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 14:57): He sounds butthurt to the max
Nate (2014-01-17 14:57): we were ignoring him because he tried to butt into a discussion and we were busy talking about things that weren't him
King Beta (2014-01-17 14:59): well I don't think there's a thing he or his brother says that doesn't annoy me
King Beta (2014-01-17 15:00) (2x <3): and I would love to drive a train into his house 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 15:12) (1x <3): I would love to drive a train period
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 15:12) (1x <3): Wear a fucking train conductor pocket watch 
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:20) (1x <3): I concur

Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:54): He's gaming us hard
Nate (2014-01-17 15:54): I wasn't gonna cum because I'm feeling hermitlike, but I guess I will if everyone is showing up
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:55): I'll probably be in jail by the end of the night
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:55): Or slapping the shit out of some girl in the bedroom
King Beta (2014-01-17 15:56): either would work
King Beta (2014-01-17 15:56): this amused me 
King Beta (2014-01-17 15:56) (1x <3): http://www.returnofkings.com/26763/girls-with-short-hair-are-damaged
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:56): Yes, I liked that article
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:57): I'm sad that Hayley Williams decided to cut her hair short
Jimmyayo (2014-01-17 15:57): Is there a correlation for men with long hair?
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-17 15:57): any ideas after the meetup
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:58): It's sexual dimorphism
Xander Xone (2014-01-17 15:58): Guys with long hair look juvenile
Nate (2014-01-17 15:58): might morphism power rangers
Nate (2014-01-17 15:59) (1x <3): y
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-17 16:27) (1x <3): hi

Nate (2014-01-18 12:42) (1x <3): On your way to deal with car?
Xander Xone (2014-01-18 12:49): @Nate What ended up happening to you last night
Nate (2014-01-18 12:51) (1x <3): Went with Phil and Amhad to the Woods.  Then went home.  Tried to game a girl on the subway, but she had a jealous colombian bf.  Gamed a girl walking back to my place from usq...
Nate (2014-01-18 12:51) (1x <3): She was staying at a friends place a block from me.  Tried to get her to come over, seemed like she was hinting at it, but she didn't bite
Nate (2014-01-18 12:51) (1x <3): Got her # tho
Xander Xone (2014-01-18 12:52): We're listening to the Christian McQueen podcast in the car
Nate (2014-01-18 12:52): :)
Nate (2014-01-18 12:52) (1x <3): I could use your help with the texting on this one, don't think I hooked that hard.  Was pretty tired so the conversation was so/so.
Nate (2014-01-18 12:53): You have the kings in your ears
Xander Xone (2014-01-18 13:20): Sure, what you need
Xander Xone (2014-01-18 13:34): Screen shot me
Nate (2014-01-18 14:18): I haven't sent anything yet
Xander Xone (2014-01-18 14:48): I need more context
Nate (2014-01-18 14:49): Well I sent my first text.  Decided I was gonna try that and see.  If she replies I'll post it
Xander Xone (2014-01-19 16:20): Jimmy is a mod again!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 16:24): Yerp
Phillatio (2014-01-19 18:42): Yay
Xander Xone (2014-01-19 18:50): What's up

Phillatio (2014-01-19 19:29): where you at
Xander Xone (2014-01-19 19:48): I'm heading back to Crown Heights at the moment. Fucking exhausted. Want to nap before going out tonight
Phillatio (2014-01-19 19:48): nice
Phillatio (2014-01-19 19:48): I'm going to watch football with schmitty

Phillatio (2014-01-19 19:53): nice dude
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 21:13): Xander how was daygaming?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 21:14): My date is drunk already. 2 glasses of white wine. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 21:14): She won't stand a chance. 
Phillatio (2014-01-19 22:01): Fish in a bucket
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 22:21): Well that was easy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-19 22:21) (3x <3): "James do you want to have sex?"
Phillatio (2014-01-20 00:14): http://i.imgur.com/z0O9k4I.jpg
Phillatio (2014-01-20 00:14) (1x <3): planning on sending that to bitches
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 12:39) (1x <3): Life hack of the day, Ahmad just discovered that almost any bluetooth mouse or keyboard work on the Nexus 5
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 12:41): @Phillatio ^ Self-love
Phillatio (2014-01-20 12:41): Always
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-20 12:53): Oh god. Feces everywhere.
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 12:54): Let me guess, she shit the bed.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 12:57): ???
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 12:57): Man I am getting hardcore one-itis with this sloot
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 12:58): @Jimmyayo Stop that
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 12:59): She is awesome though
Phillatio (2014-01-20 12:59): There are many other awesome chicks
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 12:59): She woke me up with a bj and gave me a massage
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 12:59): Doesn't matter. You're going to ruin it by developing one-itis
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:00): Yah can't wait to self-sabotage this
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:01): On Saturday, I was reminded that I need to show some vulnerability
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:01): Que pasta?
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:02): Well, seems like Katie has been driven nuts by all of my flakiness and aloof texting
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:02): But it was the point where she was getting ready to walk away
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:02): So I reeled her back in
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:03): How did u do that
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:04): I'll get to that in a minute
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:05): http://oi52.tinypic.com/1zz6pz7.jpg
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:05): @Jimmyayo Did Andres sleep over or something?

Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:09): @Jimmy I told her that I have been avoiding everyone lately, not just her. That it's a bad habit of mine when shit isn't going well. That I enjoy spending time with her a lot
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:10): Basically that I'm going through a rough patch
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:10) (1x <3): She was like, "I'm not trying to fix you" blah blah blah. Whenever a chick says that it means that they are trying to fix you
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:11) (1x <3): It reminded me that I can dial down the hardcore gaming with her somewhat
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:11): Since she is already so invested
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:12): Haha yes it does look familiar
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:12) (1x <3): In fact, I should dial it down, because if you keep sending intense player vibes, you'll drive them away
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:12): I believe i sucked that girls soul out
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:13): I'm watching Ahmad destroy/dissect his broken Nexus 5.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:16): I witnessed Andres screw it up pretty bad w/ a fledgling model/actress from LA because of not showing enough vulnerability 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 13:17) (1x <3): Pretty big lesson learned for him. He fucked a cute Israeli yesterday, after toning the game down a bit 
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:18): Good man
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:18): @Phillatio You're trying to bang her before she returns to Australia, correct?
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:21): Sí
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:22): I guess but we'll see
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:22): We will, won't we
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:22): I could just as easily cut her off and never see her again
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:24): I guess
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:24): You seem determined to have no leads lately
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:25): I'm determined to get good leads
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:25): And I'll take as long as I need to get them
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:28): I believe ya, but my tommy guy don't
Phillatio (2014-01-20 13:42) (1x <3): Date tomorrow. I think it's the girl of my dreams
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 13:54): @Phillatio A dream come true.
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 14:58) (1x <3): Ecstatic is at it again!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 15:05): Noooooooo
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 15:05): Shit he just can't help himself
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:07): Maybe I'll take him a little more seriously when he hits 21, but I somehow doubt it
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:16): I'm being motherfucking productive today
Jimmyayo (2014-01-20 15:19): GOL was pretty chill in person I thought 
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:20): I thought ecstatic was pretty chill in preson
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:21): he's still a douche 
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:23): Wheeeee
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:31): To seamless or cook, that is the question
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:32): I just had a can of sardines 
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:33): I feel like a 40 year old
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:33): I love sardines
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:33): Perhaps I should eat my pulpo
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): mmm
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): so fucking good 
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): bought a bag of apples
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): too 
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): I eat the whole thing when I eat an apple
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:34): pit and all
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:38): Same as a cock, then
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:39): dude red kings
Phillatio (2014-01-20 15:39): is awesome
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:48): @Phillatio yeah, it's pretty good
Xander Xone (2014-01-20 15:59) (1x <3): This ties into the earlier conversation about allowing yourself to be vulnerable: http://redpillgame.com/letting-her-go/
Phillatio (2014-01-20 16:07): nice ^

Xander Xone (2014-01-20 16:43): Jad
I just want to reduce them. Specially with the 9s and 10s

Phillatio (2014-01-21 14:03): he fights to protect the system
Nate (2014-01-21 14:03): I dropped some comments designed to provoke dumb people

Nate (2014-01-21 14:05): my strategy with ab is called 'scorched earth'.  I provoke his feeble mind, and then check in every once in a while to see the carnage.
Phillatio (2014-01-21 14:06): I'm just going to troll him more
Nate (2014-01-21 14:06): You should never have entertained him at all, but bravo for doing it
Phillatio (2014-01-21 14:06): maybe I'll take on the roll of the super misogynist  
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:07): Well, he's a potential client of mine, so I'm not going to completely scorch the earth yet
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:07): �

Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:08): He's on some hippie bullshit
Nate (2014-01-21 14:10) (2x <3): Red Pill is like doctor who.  When you look at it, you either head towards it, run away, or go mad.  I think he chose the third option
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:11): I've been really enjoying the redkings subreddit as of late

Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:39) (1x <3): Third, no more online dating. I can only pick up chicks I approach in real life. Furthermore, that means forcing myself to target the highest tier girls that I often bitch out on
TiMex (2014-01-21 14:40): Thanks jimmeh
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 14:43): I have been letting myself slip in many areas of my life

Nate (2014-01-21 15:22): Indeed
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 15:22): Guess I'm not giving him enough unearned validation
Nate (2014-01-21 15:22): Hence the mock
Xander Xone (2014-01-21 15:26) (1x <3): A B has no idea that I'm trolling

Nate (2014-01-21 15:38): lol that video gets funnier the longer you listen to it
Phillatio (2014-01-21 15:41): "There have been some dips in the productivity of some of my work due to lack of profiency of the technologies used. Despite these shortcomings there has been some extrodinary work that I produced this year. Most notably the cover story helper plugin and the Pharrell cover story."
Phillatio (2014-01-21 15:41): " The helper plugin will improve how we produce cover stories here at complex and should inhance productivity and ease of production of covers. Along with the cover admin I think that we've made some real strides in easing the cover development process."

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:22): closers meetup dinner...?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:22): Next wed
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:22): Well let's take a vote
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:22): 1) Mable's Smokehouse in Willyburg, or
2) Mighty Quinns in East Village?
Nate (2014-01-22 12:24): I vote for mables because Quinns doesn't have mac and cheese as a side
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:25): I'm for Quinns because it's in the East Village and close to other bars we can hang out at afterwards 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:25): seconded for quinns
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:25): my preferred side is more ribs
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 12:25): Whatever's good
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 12:26): The conversation in gaylife right now is fantastic
Nate (2014-01-22 12:26): I'm too busy pulling out my eyes to look there
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:26): Yeah i'm staying away from the morning cesspool 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:27): Xander u gotta vote for one.  Both are good.

Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:30): O  GAWD  WHY

Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:31): I guess Phillatio will be the tie b-b-b-b-breaker
Nate (2014-01-22 12:31) (1x <3): are you massaging Jad's chest with your fingers?

Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:39): YEAH HE WANTS TO BECOME AN INSTRUCTOR
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:40): damnit it wont let me leave gaylife
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:41): jesus that performance eval was a joke
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:41): my boss is so fidgety and afraid of me  
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:42): did they mention your tardy ass
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:42): not a word
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:43): in fact I didn't hear a single negative comment
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:43): Lol geebus 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:43): I want your job
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:43): what the fuck I'm late all the fucking time
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 12:43) (1x <3): I can't wait to get home and watch jads videos
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:43): I had mine last week...
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:43): if I was my boss I would fire me
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:43): I'm glad I'm not my own boss
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 12:43) (1x <3): suck his dick, then sue for harassment 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:45): I got pretty lucky, my boss had tons of stuff to dock me on.  Thankfully he only put positive remarks on the official form that gets filed - and mentioned the negative stuff in the in-person meeting
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:46): I gotta read some shit on negotiating raises
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:46): always good to be prepped for that
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:47): I'd do it only if you truly feel like you're underpaid
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 12:47): Didn't you just get a raise?
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:52): no this current evaluation is the raise I was talking about
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:52): I"m not underpaid 
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:52) (1x <3): I just want more money, cause  I'm a greedy piece of shit
Phillatio (2014-01-22 12:52): also bills
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:03): You'd rather trunk club than just buy shit yourself for 9/10 the cost
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:04): I'd say 5/10 of the cost
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:04): but yes
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:04): I pay a premium for the convenience 
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:09): I like shopping though
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:09): For about 2 hours a month
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:09): Then I hate it
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:11): haha I hate it every fucking time
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:11): I find it hard to make decisions about that kind of shit
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:11): because I literally don't give a flying mother fuck
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:12): Just went shopping ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/3264x2448.jpeg.ab28770065be0131dbf322000a2d16e3
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:12): that pic just made me cum
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:12): I love those little wax cheese things
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:12): so fucking good
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:13): Trader Joes has this English Cheddar with Italian Truffles 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:13): Picked some up last night, it's very delicious
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:13) (1x <3): sounds delicious. I just left gay life
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:13): so done
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:15): Liked
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:16): Sometimes there's some decent dialogue going on, but they regularly turn it to shit 
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:21): Gangster of Love: Bye phaggot
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:22): I just can handle it
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:22): its a waste of my intellect 
Phillatio (2014-01-22 13:22): can't* 
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:25): Who the fuck was Juan Fupa
Nate (2014-01-22 13:26): Never spoke once as far as I know
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 13:26): hehehe
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 13:27): Soy libre!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:35): Mark how goes the job prospects abroad?
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:41) (1x <3): They go well, Jimmy, thanks for asking
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:45): Not sure if u guys saw this slut's text from yest  ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/576x779.jpeg.3a08745065c30131f69622000a2d0e7b
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:45): I decided that between texting "lol" and not texting back, not texting back is the better option 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 13:45): dic pic
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:46): You're missing a key trolling opportunity
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:46): Send a national geographic pic or something
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:52): True, I've thought about that too
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 13:53): I think that would communicate something like "i dgaf what you want me to do, i'll just entertain myself"

But I think I'd rather communicate a "bitch I don't have time for your games or requests"
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:56): Sending lol is weak
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:56): Walking away is neutral but then you're probably not gonna get a bang
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 13:57): Send a pic like that and you'll at least make her laugh and/or go wtf
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:01): Why is "lol" weak?
Phillatio (2014-01-22 14:03): I think that lol is usually pretty good. But based on the context I don't think it fits well here
Phillatio (2014-01-22 14:04): it works when a bitch is going over the fucking top and you're ready to cut her off
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:10): So the situ is...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:10): She flaked last sat
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:10): I texted that it's all good but she'll make it up to me in some other way
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:10): Then she texts back 3 days later request a pic
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:11): I think that's pretty ridiculous 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:11): Bitch flakes then demands a pic so she can decide if I'm cute enough to get a date lol
Nate (2014-01-22 14:11) (1x <3): Translation: she lied about the flake reason too
Phillatio (2014-01-22 14:12): mmm
Phillatio (2014-01-22 14:12): idk regardless of those facts 
Phillatio (2014-01-22 14:12) (2x <3): I think a ridiculous picture is a way better response
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 14:16): Cool. Thx for the feedback
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 14:21): Phil is spot on. I'm busy having a bad poo
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 14:22): When is the closers meet up 
Nate (2014-01-22 14:23): Next Wed
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 14:23): Ah. There is some Brooklyn shit going on this weekend
Nate (2014-01-22 14:28): >A Buhh silly boys.. double dates are strictly for swingers and couples pretending not to be swingers
Nate (2014-01-22 14:28) (1x <3): Idiot personified

Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:14): I knew she was dumb already. but jesus
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:15): this is just asinine 
Nate (2014-01-22 15:16): Not knowing who Vladimir Putin is, is pretty bad to start
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:19): ooof

Nate (2014-01-22 15:21): Van
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 15:24): Why wouldn't she just google the name if she really didnt know
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:25): cause bitches be lazy
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:25): they expect me to do all the work
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:25): maybe I'll send her a imgtfy.com 
Phillatio (2014-01-22 15:25): http://lmgtfy.com/*

Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:00): That's funny
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:01): I think redpillers are a bit too obsessed w/ feminism 
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 16:01): They can be
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 16:02) (1x <3): I don't really care. It's just one more thing for me to manipulate
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:02): I couldn't care less about feminism. I'm in this to get more pussy, not get into debates about mens/womens rights
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 16:04) (1x <3): Leon

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:29): life is good
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:30): Working from home?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:30): I did that last 2 days, couldn't get shit done
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:30): good thing i dont have any actual work
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:31) (1x <3): other than waxing my butthole for tonight
Phillatio (2014-01-22 16:34): �
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:35) (1x <3): A city like NY is ideal, because it’s concentrated, and there are so many people and the city is sexy and anonymous. By the way, anonymity is key because as a hustler, I try (as I encourage you to) all types of new methods and approaches; some work, some work brilliantly, but alas, some fail and fall flat.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:35) (1x <3): In this city, who cares, because chances are you won’t see the person again, and even if you do, by that time you’ll be a confident playboy and who cares what one stupid bitch thinks, anyhow.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:35): Haha excellent 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:36): Paul Janka?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 16:36): Roosh?
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:42) (1x <3): I have never done online dating. I can’t recall the last time I was set-up. And after a few
retarded episodes with blind dates, I refuse to do that. All my pulls are in the flesh, and
I’m aggressive.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 16:42) (1x <3):  I believe it’s a lot about chemistry, and a privilege of males is that you
get to choose. If you see something you like, go after it. It is caveman style, but I bet
cavemen had pretty good sex lives. In fact, I’m sure they did, because we’re here. So,
make like Zog and take what you are hungry for.
Phillatio (2014-01-22 16:49): mmmmmmm
Phillatio (2014-01-22 16:49): delicious

Xander Xone (2014-01-22 17:17): Nah, I'm gonna be lazy.
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 17:17): My balls are drained from last night
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 17:19): Practically got frostbite on my fingers a few hours ago just from walking 2 blocks with groceries

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:36): love is two people of similar sexual market value chemically pairbonding to ensure sufficient parental investment
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:37): that blog post made me shed a manly teare
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:37): Female love is dread.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:37): what do you mean
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:37): At least, low-level consistent dread
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:37) (1x <3): source?
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:39): I'm gonna send you back to the source, Mark.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:40): i have seen what cannot be unseen
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:41): A fat girl's snatch.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:42): i do not trust completely, i simply give the minimal amount of genuine affection so as to prop up the illusion of mutual love
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:43): There is no soul to trust on the other end
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:43): given my understanding of womens opportunistic and hypergamous nature, its a fools errand to devote your entire spiritual being into a girl
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:44):  its a fools errand to devote your entire spiritual being into any other person 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:44): not true
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:45) (1x <3): a fellow man or dog deserves such devotion, if granted
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:45): Well maybe your child
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:45): that's not true, devote it to me.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:45): Your entire spiritual being? 
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:45): I am the light and the way.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:46): I dunno man, sure a man can't trust a woman completely but neither can a woman trust a man completely
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:47): a womans unconditional trust is easily earned if you know what youre doing
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:47): for a woman is no more than a complex collection of mechanical biological machinery 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:47): which desires a skilled conductor at its helm
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:47): take the blog post for instance
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:48): the way he describes love can be used on unsuspecting females, it makes them weak at the knees
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:49): any sort of well executed melodramatic faux poetic vulnerability is akin to crack
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:55): Tbh I'm not sure what we're talking about...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:55): I'm just horny
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:57): I like the layout of laidnyc.com 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 18:57): WYB -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqvQ-DfsaOw
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 18:58): anyway i agree with that commenter... too much manosphere is bad for you
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:58): Also agree
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 18:58): @Phillato I wonder when our video will be up on guyism.com
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 18:59): But he's right - it's good to understand the core concepts, internalize the stuff that you need to reach your goals, then go out and live life again
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:00): I'm gonna stalk LaidNYC until I find him.
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:02): I'm not going to the closers meetup unless Andres is there.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:03) (1x <3): Guess you aren't going to the closers meetup then
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:05): You'll have to tell me how it goes
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:07): Jesus, there are so many Jad videos. I guess I'll start from the beginning.
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:08): i stopped watching after the 2nd video
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:08): too much chode
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:09): I think I'll jump to the latest video after the 2nd earliest.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:09): As a friend of his...it's admittedly hard to stomach 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:10): watching his approaches makes me want to approach more
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:10): i feel like being a perfectionist is keeping me from approaching 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:11): but after watching his approaches, i feel a lot better about mine
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:12) (1x <3): I don't dislike the guy. I feel for him. But that being said
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:12) (1x <3): ...yeah
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:13) (1x <3): Nothing that need be repeated
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:13): Who is coming to Williamsburg tonight
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:15): I think that Katie is starting to want a real relationship out of me. I made some flippant comment about other girls and she was like, "And that's why I make you bag it twice."
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:17): I don't want to be sucked in too much
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:18): How often do u see her?
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:18): I was seeing her once a week, but it's kinda drifting toward twice a week lately.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:19): >1x per week is relationship-zone
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:19): Oops, i mean greater than 1x per week
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:19): There's no such thing as being 'sucked in' if you are the one controlling the pace of things
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:19): &gt; 1x per week
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:19): @Alpha No shit, Sherlock
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:20): Xander is going to be Arab in 10 days time.. already eating figs
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:20): I'm hopped up on fig newtons right now
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:20): Also there doesn't exist any clear demarcation between relationship and non relationship in terms of frequency
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:20): If its so obvious xander then why are you so afraid
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:21): I'm not afraid
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:21): At least not more than anything else
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:21): So, absolutely terrified
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:22): In my experience it's been 1x/week anyhow.  Obv not a hard rule.  Any more than 1x/week and things get relationshippy.  Less than 1x/week and things stay casual.  
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:22): It's more like 1x a week with an occasional extra time thrown in
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:23): And the pace feels pretty good
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:24): I like the chick a lot. We get along well and slap each other in the bedroom
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:25): So my chick, the blonde azn, pissed me off 2 days ago.  We started getting too relationshippy so I put her on the backburner for a few days...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:25): Well 2 days ago, she shows up at my doorstep, unannounced
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:25) (1x <3): Mistake one: Her knowing where you live.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:26): She comes in, asks if I want to go grab dessert, I say no I'm busy 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:26): And I truly was, catching up on work. So she's chillin on my couch reading the paper
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:26): I had to tell her that she should never do this, coming un-announced 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:27): This is a product of things geting too relationshippy and her getting way too comfortable with me
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:28): You have to set boundaries
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:28) (2x <3): I will often not let them in if they show up without warning
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:28): I think you did the right thing aside from letting her in
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:28): I like not even having to worry about that situation
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:29): I only got 2/3 of the way through Jad's first video before I had to turn it off. It's like a really poorly edited field report/therapy session
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:31): And I guess that his latest video is him fucking a chick in a bathroom. Lovely.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:31): No shit, rly?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:31): Okay i gotta see this
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:33) (1x <3): I immediately regret that decision
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:33): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObyKl7tcAyw
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:33): No no no no no
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:33): EVERYONE WATCH
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:34): http://www.coolestfamilyever.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/now-kiss.png
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:34): Is she taking a dump while he masturbates onto her?
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:35) (1x <3): Ahmad: "I can't see her face"
Me: "Yeah, probably for good reason."
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-22 19:36): I demand my money back
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:36): Here's your $0.00 back, sir.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:36): Urrgghhhhhh mannnnnn
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:37): WTF is he even talking about
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:37): "State is something that was completely made up by PUA coaches...

...gaming yourself means to lie to yourself..."
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:38): Aw shit, everything I have believed so far is wrong!
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:41): In Game yourself part 1 - Jad talks about how you take your penis and fuck the shit out of it... in part 2 - he shows u exactly how its done
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43): ....
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43): ....wait
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43): ait
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43): WTF 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43) (1x <3): WTF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJGAxTyQ74
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:43) (1x <3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJGAxTyQ74
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:54): Don't ask a fish how to catch it, ask the fisher who caught it 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:54): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woI_UsUasY4
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:56): Holy fuck that interviewer is awkward
Xander Xone (2014-01-22 19:57): Yes he is
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:57): He's like a bigger version of LTD
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 19:58): out of the 331 sec in that video, only 5 sec were helpful 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 19:58) (2x <3): Well the blond bartender is pretty accurate.  Every other chick is busy revealing how stupid she is. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 20:01): "You're gonna have a bunch of guys come around talking to you...
What's...
How do you want a guy...
How am I gonna be able to get your number, 
If I wanna say Hi, and talk to you later?"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 20:01): Fucking idiot 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-22 20:18): Some hidden-in-plain-sight video cams:

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 20:52): Just got my new phone --- sweet
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-22 21:15) (1x <3): @ jimmy http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1b4f891845a799af209fb8409&id=5e2a94e34d&e=36381368de

Xander Xone (2014-01-22 23:43) (1x <3): Just saw a beeeyooootiful girl on tinder. She made my heart skip a beat.
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 00:54): Ugh, gaylife is boring me
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 00:57): Yah. Too many KJ's that 1) don't do their homework, and 2) don't get the field experience 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 00:57) (1x <3): I want to kill Fox 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 00:57): That guy sucks
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 00:57): Daygame doesn't werkkkkk
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 00:57): He just asked if its okay if he dates an unattractive girl
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 00:58) (1x <3): lol. I don't think God is going to judge him, if that's what he means
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 00:58) (1x <3): I think Gangster of Love is doing a disservice to Gotham with some of his advice.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 01:00): Yep
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 01:02) (1x <3): I somehow missed that Paul Janka link. Can you link me again Jimmy

Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 01:11) (1x <3): No assholeyness!
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 01:12) (1x <3): But then how will I pick up chicks

Nate (2014-01-23 10:34): you double date or something?
Nate (2014-01-23 10:34): or the ole 3rd wheel date
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:34): double date
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:34): but she was a huge daft cunt
Nate (2014-01-23 10:35): how could it go well then?  You bang her and then kick her to the curb after degrading her?
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:36): oh the friend was a daft cunt
Nate (2014-01-23 10:36): ahh
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:36) (1x <3): my date was passable 
Nate (2014-01-23 10:37) (1x <3): I thought the whole point of working from home was being able to goof off.  Yesterday I had to work much harder than normal, even stayed late...
Nate (2014-01-23 10:37): *worked
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:38): that blows
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:38) (1x <3): chunckies

Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:39) (1x <3): and didn't get anything out of it
Nate (2014-01-23 10:39): stop that!
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 10:42): Pretty much time to give up
Nate (2014-01-23 10:42): No such time
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:43): my penis hurts
Nate (2014-01-23 10:44): I weep for your penis.  It's so sore from all the sex
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:45): she literally fucked me into exhaustion all while smoking copious amounts of pot 
Nate (2014-01-23 10:46): Aussies.  They come from the hardiest of the english criminals bred in a country where everything is trying to kill you.
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:47): hear about that plant that when it stings you it hurts so bad people have committed suicide 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:47): ?
Nate (2014-01-23 10:47): I too read reddit :)
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:48): just checking
Nate (2014-01-23 10:48): don't forget drop bears, or giant spiders
Nate (2014-01-23 10:49): http://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/things-in-australia-that-will-kill-you-animals-that-will-try-to-kill-you
Phillatio (2014-01-23 10:52): sweet, sweet baby jesus
Nate (2014-01-23 10:53): baby jesus tries to kill you there too
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:02): Yay Phil!
Nate (2014-01-23 11:10): @Mark you bang the bitchy one?
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:14): haha she left in a huff 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:14) (1x <3): cause her friend was getting some and she wasn't
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:19): i thought about kissing her but i was so not interested
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:20): yeah I could tell 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:20): I'm glad that portion ended when it did
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:21): it was fun fucking with them though
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:21): squishy bitch be squishy
Phillatio (2014-01-23 11:22): lol 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 11:25): they were both aussies?
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:27): So you did fuck her, Phil
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:37) (1x <3): oh phil fucked her alright
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:38) (1x <3): theyre the criminal, beach slut, working class type of aussie
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:38): not that theres anything wrong with that
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 11:38): Was the other chick 5'8” with black hair
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:39): something like that, although they looked much hotter in their tinder pics... what a surprise
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 11:40): Yup I know I saw both at 13 step
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:40): i love how you can instantly distinguish the social class of a british/aussie girl from their accent
Nate (2014-01-23 11:41) (2x <3): or from their presence at 13 step
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 11:41): Phil's chick is wide..like she can play football with his balls
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:41): Oh no...
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:41): hey dont knock 13 bros
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 11:41): I never get ID at 13
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:42) (1x <3): 13th step is the classiest of establishments
Nate (2014-01-23 11:42): Not knocking 13 step.  No better place to find slutty girls
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:42): East village's best kept secret
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 11:42) (1x <3): you mean girls?
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:42): but you get a full cavity search instead, ahmad
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 11:42): Of course 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:43) (1x <3): so i woke up 30min late for my round 2 interview today
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:43) (1x <3): go me

Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:43): I like your style, kid. You're hired.

Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:48): Forget employment, it's time to slay some new poos
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:48): I'm glad that Phil's cold streak ended
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:51): ive been keeping him warm this winter
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:51): Apparently
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:51): My cold streak is getting pretty bad at the moment
Nate (2014-01-23 11:51): I'm gradually turning back into a virgin

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:52): oh no...
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:53) (1x <3): This cold makes me want to curl up and die though
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:53) (1x <3): im going to go outside and then immediately walk back indoors
Nate (2014-01-23 11:54): I have two sweaters on and a space heater next to me, and I'm still cold
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:54) (1x <3): I tried to insta-date her, but she died of exposure on the way to Starbucks...
Nate (2014-01-23 11:54): I'm going to remain sexless because I don't want to go outside
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:55): And no, I did not offer her my scarf because chivalry is dead
Nate (2014-01-23 11:55): Chivalry was around in the times when women were property
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:56): Women are chattel
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:56): women open doors for me
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:56): They just think that they aren't these dayz
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:56): Soon my dog Sparky is gonna try to run the show
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:57): god i need a dog
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:57): im so lonely
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:58): When are we all getting a place together so we can have a pickup dog
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 11:59): when you become cash flow positive
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 11:59): I haven't gotten my car wash up and running yet

Xander Xone (2014-01-23 12:15): I'm a little sad that Katie's haircut took an inch off of her hair
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 12:15): At least she made me these ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/810x1080.jpeg.ec048420667f0131f69622000a2d0e7b
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 12:21): @Phil Ahmad thinks you could have SNL'd your chick
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 12:39): Yup but he was too drunk 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 12:57): Nah
Phillatio (2014-01-23 12:57): Her friend dragged her away

Phillatio (2014-01-23 12:59): Lol
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:00): @Phil You didn't seem to pleased with me that night
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:01): Oh that was the night you went back with what's her face
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:01): Nah I didn't care
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:01): You're so full of shit, haha
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:02): Kay lol I'm not though

Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:02): Kinda cute
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:04): Book hording, eh
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:08): resembles a flawed emma stone
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:08): Still though flawed Emma is better than no Emma
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:09): Doesn't matter; had banter
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:12): heheh
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:14) (1x <3): im done with online game, tired of wasting resources on mediocre chicks
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:14) (2x <3): its not even about taking the low hanging fruit, its picking up the half-fermented shit off the ground
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:16): I feel the same way
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:16): meh whatever 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:16): it is what it is
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:17) (1x <3): I'm working on my tinder guide. Once I finish, tinder will be done-zo
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:17): I just went through all my matches and sorted them into lists
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:18): took about an hour
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:18): I had 240 matches
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:20): I'd rather have 10 blowouts a day with top tier bitches than bang another 6
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:20): id rather have one 8 than ten 6s
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:20): and true 8s wouldnt touch online game with a 10 foot pole
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:21): well true 9s wouldn't
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:21) (1x <3): although i will say that online game has one real benefit, and that is getting really good at 1st dates
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:21): there's a few 8s out there
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:21): online
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:21): once you get good at 1st dates, its time to move on
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:21): I found one decent chick out of dozens of tinder dates
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:23): Pretty much like searching for a needle in a haystack
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:24): hm 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:24): well 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:24): I still thinks there's some merit to it and that it can be useful in down times
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:24): once warm weather comes around and I can do day game though. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:25): I just think that I'm self-limiting at this point
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:26): its simply the natural evolution of things
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:26): I don't want to merely be king of the ants
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:26): you get competent at one medium and now its time to move onto something more challenging and rewarding
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:27): you have to keep in mind that people are at different stages of their growth
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:28): Now that I'm competent with tinder, I really see the diminishing returns
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:28): I would have to work so much harder to get more out of it
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:28): i think were at similar points along the curve
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:29): I would rather put that kind of energy into other mediums
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:29): Better to be a day game expert than an online dating expert
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:29): other folks may very well have much untapped potential to exploit online
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:30): and some may find it hard to jump straight into something more challenging like daygame
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:30): at least thats how i felt about it
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:30) (2x <3): i dont think anyone in this chatroom exploits online game as much as us
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:30): definitely not
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 13:31): <applause>
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 13:31): </applause>
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:31): Pippy should be appearing any moment now...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 13:31): >Alpha Overlordalthough i will say that online game has one real benefit, and that is getting really good at 1st dates

good point
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 13:32): I crashed through quite a few daygame girls w/ bad first date game
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 13:32): Before I could work out some sort of system
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:32) (1x <3): 1st date game, get them liquored up and then grope away
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:33): mm yeah good for 1st dates. good for text game
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 13:33) (1x <3): get them liquored up and take em to the peachtree dance
Phillatio (2014-01-23 13:33): then give them a whole bunch of coke
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 13:33): *pretends to understand Daniel's reference*
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:48): There's an event going on in Brooklyn this Saturday

Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:54): Xander Xone
@Jimmyayo
 It's pretty much like shooting fish in a barrel. When I lived in a 
party house during college and threw parties all of the time, chicks 
would throw themselves at me
1
A B
that's coz you so sexy xandalf
not everyone is blessed with yo looks
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:55): what a little shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:56): A B comes across as something of a game denialist
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 14:56): Yeah...a bit
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 14:56): I think some of u guys were telling me how he was constantly making excuses for not approaching?
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:56): Yes, that was me
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:57): I never went out with him again after that experience
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:57): He is truly a debbie downer
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 14:57): I had a similar experience w/ him @ daygame.  He kept saying that none of these girls were not attractive to him...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 14:58): Which is complete BS, as anyone who's been to grand central during rush hour can attest to
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:58): he approached while I was with him
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:58): but was a complete bumbling idiot at it
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:59): he's so full of shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:59): At least he approached when you were with him. He didn't approach a single time all night, and it was night game
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:59): that's what really bothers me. Not that he's awkward or another fucking brown guy 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 14:59): its that he's so fucking full of it
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:59): I must have seen something like 100 bangable chicks that night
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 14:59): "I didn't see anything that I liked"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:00): Hmmm....what is it?  Do u think it's cuz he has a very sensitive ego
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:01): yeah and he's socially anxious 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:01): he's trying to fit in 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:01): "I... want... to... fit... in."
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:02): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vBpcSEdcRc

Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:03): Boss I don't have FB

Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:18): that's kinda nice
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-23 15:19): That Nice (with a middle eastern accent)
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:26): Xander, what neighborhood is that in?
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:28): East Williamsburg
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:28): L Train?
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:28): Sí
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:28): I'll go if it's L train-friendly
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:29): It's kinda far
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:30): You have to walk a block from the Morgan Av L stop
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:30): I could arrange for a taxi if you would like
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:30): Morgan??
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:30): That's Bushwick
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:31): Almost
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:32): Same difference
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:32): The more east you go, the more Real Hipsterish you get
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:32): That's the point
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:32): West williamsburg = rich hipsters w/ trust fund accounts
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:33) (1x <3): East = poor artists that survive on dumplings and ramen, then make art out of their dumpling/ramen shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:33): Exactly
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:33): Why would I want a girl with money
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:33): Is that a trick question....
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:33): Female dependence is the heart of seduction
Nate (2014-01-23 15:34): That's easy.  I want a girl who is dependent on me emotionally, but buys me cars and first class trips
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:35): Time to up your game then
Nate (2014-01-23 15:35): Well yeah.  That's a pipe dream right now
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:36): It's quite simple really. The more financially destitute, the more desperate for security the girls are, the more the market tips in the favor of males
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:36): Economics 101
Nate (2014-01-23 15:37): Histrionics 101
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:37): Heh heh
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:37): Have u guys seen the movie Her
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:38): you mean 'the beta king'
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:38): Hrd it's pretty good
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:38): Nope
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:38): If you'll notice, the guys in  Williamsburg tend to be busted while their girlfriends tend to be hotter than them
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:38): Yah apparently the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix is a total beta nutjob 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:39): Reeaaaaaallyyyyyy
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:39): i saw Her last night
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:39): good shit
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:39): Word?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:39): I hrd it has a fairly twisted ending 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:39): @Jimmy Absolutely
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:39): im watching wolf of wall st tonight
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:39) (1x <3): That's the first thing I noticed when I started going out there
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:40): Shit that was my dilemma tonight - to watch Wolf or Her, for my movie date
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:40): I like the sound of that
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:40): wolf is a bro movie, watch it with dudes
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:40): And I have a hard time believing that every hipster guy in Williamsburg suddenly learned game
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:41): So it must be more for environmental reasons
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:41): there are other external markers of value aside from game and physicality, obv
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:41): musicians get poon for a reason
Nate (2014-01-23 15:41): I don't think there are quite as many busted guys in wburg as you are making it out to be xan
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 15:41): so do hippy save the whales types
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:42): Probably
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:42): I don't really know much
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:42): Yah, I'd think in the hipster's sexual market, the hipster guy gets automatic points for being, well, a hipster.  And having the congruent sensitive pussy-ass beta personality
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:43) (1x <3): That means that you'll kill it out there
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:43): Ohhhhhhhhhhh.gif
Nate (2014-01-23 15:43): Most of the hipsters in wburg I knew with hot girls were pretty good looking, 'artistic' guys, who were total losers 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:44): I dunno, maybe I just prefer that type of girl for some reason
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:44) (1x <3): its called dana syndrome
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:44): Yah, a different scoring system than Manhattan
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:45): Dana is dead to me.
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:45): haha
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:45): I like those hipster girls too 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:45): easier to talk to 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:45) (1x <3): I think I'm burned out on Manhattan for the time being
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:46): It all began with that 30+ days when I went out every single day
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:46): There are good ideas, and there are bad ideas.  That would belong in the latter. 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:46): haha I'm definitely not burned out on Manhattan. but I could tone it down a little and intermix some brooklyn poon
Nate (2014-01-23 15:46): @Xander you also spent most of your time in places like 13 step.  There are many different circles.
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:47): My game was pretty insane by the end of it, but I was so exhausted that I didn't even care any more
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:47) (1x <3): You lose it quickly
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:48): ain't that the truth
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:49): Speaking of movie nights...i did have the best movie date ever watching American Psycho on Netflix w/ one of my new chicks.  She was eating that shit up, which gave me the hardest hardy mc hard-on
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:49): Lol, Katie didn't like it
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:49) (3x <3): last night I was flexing in the mirror while banging that chick doggy 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:49) (1x <3): dead serious. It was pretty awesome 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 15:49): Haaaa
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:52): The whole thing sickens me at the moment
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:52): I can't look at girls as anything other than objects
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:53): I'm trying to change that a little bit with my harem
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:53): But just the thought of going out and picking up new chicks... I feel nauseous
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:53): And not from anxiety
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:54): It's existential
Nate (2014-01-23 15:54): @Xander Have you tried the gay?
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:55): I can never tell if you're being melodramatic, a debbie downer or just seriously depressed 
Nate (2014-01-23 15:56): I believe the answer is yes
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:56): It doesn't matter that I feel confident and generally good about myself when the world out there is so shitty
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:57): that's such bullshit
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:57): I weep for the world.
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 15:58): But like the lotus flower, I must remain above and untouched by the muck as I make my way
Nate (2014-01-23 15:59): If everything about the world sucks.  It's probably just you
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:59): you should practice the art of optimism 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 15:59): I'm pretty much a master of it
Nate (2014-01-23 16:00): Also spend less time caring about why others suck
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:00): Lol, now there's a good joke
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:00): http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/767/7672287/2361855-6442745602-wpid-m.jpeg
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:00): Sorry that was douchey
Nate (2014-01-23 16:01): You're not sorry
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:01): no it was warranted 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:03): But in general xander you do seem to let yourself dwell in this spiral of negative thinking 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:04): Not that I have any accurate idea what's going on in that fucked up head of yours 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:14): fuck osx Maverick 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:14): buggy crap 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:19): I'm on my worst behavior
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:19) (1x <3): Mothafuckas never loved us
Nate (2014-01-23 16:20): This isn't your worst behavior, you can do much worse ;)
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:22): 💊💊💊
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:24): All those pick ups will be lost in time... Like tears in rain...
Nate (2014-01-23 16:26) (2x <3): http://aaslestad.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bladerunner.gif?w=500&h=223
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:28): I'm horny
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:29) (1x <3): maybe I should bang this 33 year old that hit me up 
Nate (2014-01-23 16:29) (1x <3): I pasted a pic of Charles Manson in place of of Mark Manson.  Let's see if anyone calls me on it
Nate (2014-01-23 16:29): in the gotham chat
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:30): @Phil Is her name Ellen

Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:32): she has body pics so I know she isn't
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:33): Like me
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:34): I'm trying to remember the names of all the girls I've slept with
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:35): Impossibru
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:35): yeah I'm blanking on a few 
Alpha Overlord (2014-01-23 16:35): I stopped counting after #20
Nate (2014-01-23 16:35) (1x <3): I have a hard enough time remembering your names
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:35): Sometimes I remember girls out of the blue
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:36): It's always a pleasant surprise
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:37): GayLife always reverts to talking about the simplest, most obvious pick up crap
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:37) (1x <3): And then throwing in the wrong advice
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:38) (1x <3): Anti-game
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:38): Philly I went through that exercise last night
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:38): I have almost every chick I've slept w/ as a contact in my phone, minus 3 that I can remember off the top of my head
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:42): How many lays do you guys think you have under your belt?  I mean after you started gaming
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:42): 1-10?
11-20?
21-30?
31-40?
41-50?
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:42): After I started gaming? Not that much
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:43): Rly? I find that a little surprising
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:44): With online game I thought pussy would be swarming around your knickers
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:44): You underestimate how many dates I flake on, and furthermore how many I go on are duds
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:45): Plus, I have a lot of returning pussy that takes up slots that could otherwise go to new puss
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:45): Word
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:46): And not hanging a real place to pull chicks for most of the time since I moved out here
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:46): *having
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:47): All of my pulls except for one have been to the girl's place
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:48): just texted this girl I almost slept with awhile back
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:48): she's argentinian or something
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:48): "Q te te iso te lo iso bueno" 
Phillatio (2014-01-23 16:48): wut the fuck does that mean
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:49) (2x <3): Logistics really are king, hence why I would bang new chicks every week in college when my room was feet away from the party
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 16:49): Truth
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 16:49): I have basically been playing the game on hard mode

Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 17:10): Which wasn't even true, we've ordered chinese and watched netflix too

Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 23:24): Nahmean?

Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 23:29) (1x <3): You've been hanging w/ Asian mark too much
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 23:30): I've barely hung out with him any lately

Xander Xone (2014-01-23 23:53): Infancy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-23 23:56): That's a good thing, discomfort means ur pushing yourself 
Xander Xone (2014-01-23 23:59): My night game and what little of my day game muscle I had has atrophied

Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:37): good morning gentlemints 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 10:39): Oh hai~
Nate (2014-01-24 10:39) (1x <3): *waves*
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:40): I didn't get the amsterdam job
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:40): because I was a fucking moron during the technical interview
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 10:42): Was it arbitrarily difficult?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 10:43): I've had *SO* many technical interviews where they'd ask really random, tough questions that were completely irrelevant to the position
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:44): no it wasn't like that I should have known this
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 10:44): Lots of times it was because the senior dev wanted to jack off and show how much smarter he is than me
Nate (2014-01-24 10:45): I particularly like when they ask you to re-implement something completely unnecessary, like link lists, sorting, and other things noone will ever do in real life
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:46): yeah this wasn't a bullshit question
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:47): it was good
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:47): I just didn't answer it right 
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-01-24 10:47): Xander Xone has rejoined the group

Xander Xone (2014-01-24 10:50): Hello gentlefolk
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:53): I'm going to write the lady an email
Phillatio (2014-01-24 10:53): see if I can push it 
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 10:53) (1x <3): F close

Phillatio (2014-01-24 11:10): weird that's what I wanted to post
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 11:40): @Phil I like the name of that website. About to read the article
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 11:43): I liked the article, not a fan of his writing style but content rang true w/ me
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 11:45) (1x <3): I'm gonna write a field report or something
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 11:45) (1x <3): And then promptly end my life
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 11:50): Check out @YouSoWould's Tweet: https://twitter.com/YouSoWould/status/426654667490463744

Nate (2014-01-24 11:56) (2x <3): I overcooked a chicken once.  It was pretty hypergamy too.
Phillatio (2014-01-24 11:56): HAHA /r/dadjokes
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:05): @Jimmy I agree, writing style sucks but the content is spot on
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 12:09) (2x <3): Xander no homo reading your FR would make me cum in my pants instantly
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 12:09): Please fucking write it
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:09): It's going to be highly self-critical
Nate (2014-01-24 12:10): I would cum in your pants instantly too
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 12:10): Why, if u got the lay?
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:10): I'm wondering if I should come up with a new reddit handle
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:11) (1x <3): Because I was a lil bitch the entire day
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:11): Not approaching even at the bar. Basically just walked into Ahmad's set
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:11): Something is terribly wrong
Nate (2014-01-24 12:12) (1x <3): @Xan if your're not gonna work you might as well start doing approaches daily, that'll fix that
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:12): I should have come out
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:12): that's what went wrong
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:13) (1x <3): @Phillatio I assumed you weren't �
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:14) (1x <3): Also, what is it about Australian bitches and them having shoulders like a linebacker
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:17): I don't understand why I'm back to square one with approaching. I know that once I'm in the set for 10+ seconds, I start to flourish
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:17): I default to my charismatic mindfuckery
Nate (2014-01-24 12:18) (1x <3): @Xander lack of practice.  I haven't been approaching as much and last weekend I was all in my head.
Nate (2014-01-24 12:18): Also you wussed out once and then started obsessing over it.  The long you thought about it, the more it became real
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:19): Yeah. I just need to get back to where I can rush through the first few seconds and get to where I excel
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:19): Which is basically everything else
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:21): The energy of activation required for my approaches has risen too high. I need an approach anxiolytic enzyme
Nate (2014-01-24 12:23): I've been playing a lot of Minecraft lately...
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:23): I've been mining vagina
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:23) (1x <3): I've been mining nose gold 
Nate (2014-01-24 12:25) (1x <3): http://www.doctornerdlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/minecraft_creeper.jpg
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:26) (1x <3): Damn, it feels good to not be part of GayLife
Nate (2014-01-24 12:26): It's good sometimes.  Otherwise I just tune out and do something else
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:27): Any ideas for a new reddit handle?
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:28): I might just start writing again under the one that my ex-gf knows about
Nate (2014-01-24 12:28): Lestat
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:28): Since it has some old school red pill comments attached to it
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:29): @Nate Many women I have slept with have described me as a vampire
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:29) (1x <3): "You're pale, dark and brooding and I only see you at night"
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:30): I want my name to include "incubus"
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:32): Yeah, if anyone is ever interested in seeing my old bullshit that I commented on, check u/Are_You_A_Real_Man
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:34): That was a dark period of my life
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:34): hehe
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:35): darker than now eh?
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:35): A blackness that consumes all light
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:36): You don't know dark
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:37): no I don't
Nate (2014-01-24 12:37): I prefer my blackness in pink form
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:38): I think there might be some good stuff in there
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:38): I used to post articles in red pill
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:38): Mostly it's me jacking off
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:42): I feel like coming up with a reading list for beta dudes who are new to the red pill
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:42): The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People would be on there
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:43): I don't think betas can read any red pill and actually comprehend it
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:43): they fight to protect the system
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:44): That's the thing, it approaches the subject from the perspective of evolutionary biology
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:46): So it's chock full of colorful examples from the animal kingdom backed up with peer-reviewed evidence
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 12:46): I highly recommend it to anyone in here. It's entertaining and well written 
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:48): CEOs should be CEOs because of their own merits
not based on their gender
yes of course
so you can't force women into those positions
so it means men have more merits than women
?
don't you think that's weird?
so it means if you push some agenda to make more women CEOs you're pushing a hypocritical system
you can't do that
or society is configured in a way women are less allowed to get there
but is a lot of things that takes us to that
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:48): go to a kids store
most of girls games are of home and cooking
that's because those are feminine attributes
and very attractive attributes I might add
i was there recently and we were astonished with that
home and cooking?
yes its attractive to meet a girl that can cook
there's no cooking gene
it's attractive for a men to cook too
I don't see boys toys like that
everybody should know how to cook
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:48): ah shit you can't tell whos who
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:48) (1x <3): well the one that's talking logically is me
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:49): ugh. 
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:49): I can't fucking argue with her
Nate (2014-01-24 12:51): Yeah can't argue.  Everyone should know how to cook
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:51): yeah sure 
Nate (2014-01-24 12:51): *for me
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:52): still though 
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:52): there's something fundamentally wrong with analyzing kids toys 
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:53): and applying some feminized equality bull shit to it
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:53) (1x <3): men and women are different and kids toys should fucking reflect that. We're not the fucking same gender 
Nate (2014-01-24 12:54): They are different, and they always will be
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:54): boys want fucking legos and tonka trucks
Nate (2014-01-24 12:54): and guns
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:54): and girls want dolls and cooking shit
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:54): right
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:54): its just so fucking backwards they can't accept the fact that there are differences 
Nate (2014-01-24 12:54): Girls don't make every stick in their yard into a gun.  They make them into tea sets
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:55): between the genders
Nate (2014-01-24 12:55): Why are you even listening to women who try to do that.  It's what I call idiot noise.
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:58): I'm trying to argue logically
Phillatio (2014-01-24 12:58): again
Nate (2014-01-24 13:00): You can't argue logically with an illogical person.  That's like asking a dog to do calculus
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 13:10): Why are you bothering with Marcelle argument
Phillatio (2014-01-24 13:11): hold on
Phillatio (2014-01-24 13:11): I'm making progress
Phillatio (2014-01-24 13:11) (1x <3): I got her to admit that the physical differences between the genders influence our behavoir
Phillatio (2014-01-24 13:12): even though she's like: "oh our behavior is all culturally based"
Phillatio (2014-01-24 13:12): bull fucking shit

Xander Xone (2014-01-24 19:17): Fudgepacking, more like.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-24 19:17) (1x <3): My Japanese wench just told me she cooked up some dinner so might head to hers later
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 19:18): Union Pool is pretty much like poosy paradise. I don't want Jad to muddy the waters of that oasis.
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 19:19): It's not too cold for Williamsburg. Drink until you can't feel the pain anymore.
Xander Xone (2014-01-24 19:21) (1x <3): The subways are warm.

Nate (2014-01-25 11:16): Annoying maybes
Nate (2014-01-25 11:16): also 2pm is not night
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:14): Aaaaaand I feel like shit
Nate (2014-01-25 12:17): Drinking, not even once
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:17): Wut that mean
Nate (2014-01-25 12:19): I assume you feel like shit from the magic of drinkies
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:20): Yes
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:20): Yes
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:20): I also had a pretty bad night in terms of game
Nate (2014-01-25 12:21): Of course, I wasn't there.  How good could it be
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:32) (1x <3): http://i.imgur.com/c6xZZM2.jpg
Nate (2014-01-25 12:33): I need feminism to give me an easy way to tell which girls are bitches, so I can avoid them
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:45) (2x <3): I hate drinking
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:46): I wanna bang a hot negress
Nate (2014-01-25 12:47): They aren't easy to find.  Most black chicks are pretty ugly
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:47): Show her what the white man can do
Nate (2014-01-25 12:47): Just make sure to wrap your wang.  20x more likely to have an std
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:48) (1x <3): You're a good girl and you know it
Nate (2014-01-25 12:49): Aww shucks
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 12:51): Well, my laptop overheated again and shut down.
Nate (2014-01-25 12:54): that's not good
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 13:08): Giving up on life
Nate (2014-01-25 13:16): Don't do that, because tacos
TiMex (2014-01-25 13:22): Nate, that pic you posted
TiMex (2014-01-25 13:22): Maybe she meant 2 drinks?
Nate (2014-01-25 13:24): I sent back that I can't meet until 7, so if that's what she meant that's fine
Nate (2014-01-25 13:25): She's japanese so her english is slightly broken.  Plus she's getting on my nerves with the maybes
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 13:26): Bloken
Nate (2014-01-25 13:27): If she wasn't really hot and kinda fun to talk to in person, I'd delete her #
Nate (2014-01-25 13:28): @Timex hmm, I think you're right.  lol
Nate (2014-01-25 13:28): That makes me like her much more
Nate (2014-01-25 13:31) (1x <3): lmao.  That makes perfect sense. I'm dense
TiMex (2014-01-25 13:34): Haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 13:54): Who wants to make whoopee
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 13:55): 🍣
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 14:58): Two girls just asked me out within one minute of each other on tinder
Nate (2014-01-25 15:04): tag team
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:06): Definitely time to get rid of of it
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:07): The desperate chicks are turning rabid
Nate (2014-01-25 15:07): and rabid chicks are turning tricks
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:09): I'm reading How to Get Out of Debt, Stay Out of Debt, and Live Prosperously: Based on the Proven Principles and Techniques of Debtors Anonymous by Jerrold Mundis
Nate (2014-01-25 15:10): I think the easiest thing you can do is have some sort of income generating thing
Nate (2014-01-25 15:10): or rob a bank
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:10): Obviously, but I didn't really have a full grasp on my debt until a few days ago
Nate (2014-01-25 15:13): The bank's bottom line is enhanced by you
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:17): I haven't the foggiest idea what you mean
Nate (2014-01-25 15:17): Learn english!
Nate (2014-01-25 15:18): The interest if your debt funds their bottom line
Nate (2014-01-25 15:18): *of
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:22): Don't nigger out on me!
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:23): Their bottom line isn't enhanced if too many people are defaulting on their obligations
Nate (2014-01-25 15:23): I'm honkeying out
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:23): Then the bank collapses
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:23): So all of you should start doing that
Nate (2014-01-25 15:23): I don't have any debt
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:23): Because it's good for society
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:24): Then incur some
Nate (2014-01-25 15:24): I'd rather get rich instead
Nate (2014-01-25 15:24): I don't want society to collapse, I want to own it
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:31): I don't want to go back to work but I guess I have to
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:31): I want to be irresponsible for the rest of my life
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:37): This always happens. It's like I get worsening approach anxiety for getting back in the grind
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:37): It's all related
Nate (2014-01-25 15:38): Although not at all logical.  You already get so many women
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:38): None of it is logical
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:39): My brain is the worst saboteur
Nate (2014-01-25 15:40): Me too, brains suck
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:53): All that matters is right now, and right now I'm perfectly alright.
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:55): I have a roof over my head, I have clothes on my back and I have enough to eat.
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 15:55): It's time to stop merely surviving and start living!
Phillatio (2014-01-25 15:57) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/640x1136.jpeg.2ac2925068310131f69622000a2d0e7b
Phillatio (2014-01-25 15:57): What's a good response
Nate (2014-01-25 15:59): Depends, do you want it to be her and you tonight, or do you want to sound busy doing fun things?
Phillatio (2014-01-25 16:00): Her and me tonight would be great
Nate (2014-01-25 16:00): Well you could always say "Meeting you for a drink at <bar>" :)
Nate (2014-01-25 16:01): Although don't take my advice, I'm not an expert
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:01): I'm a game denialist
Nate (2014-01-25 16:02): denial is a river in egypt
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:02): She'll either like you or she won't because of your looks and status and there is nothing else you can do about it
Phillatio (2014-01-25 16:02): Wow that's depressing
Nate (2014-01-25 16:03) (1x <3): I'm ugly and in a boring job.  I guess I'm doomed to be alone forever
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:03) (1x <3): Imagine being female and basically having the looks thing be true
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:03) (1x <3): Now that's depressing
Phillatio (2014-01-25 16:08): Status can change looks is more difficult
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:09): Yes, but looks are about third on the list for guys. They are 95% of everything for girls
Nate (2014-01-25 16:12): Not really.  They are 95% of the initial attraction before she opens her mouth.  
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:13): Ya really
Xander Xone (2014-01-25 16:14): They say that money make a nigger act nigger-ish
Jimmyayo (2014-01-25 16:20): At least a nigga nigga richhhhh

Xander Xone (2014-01-25 21:55): even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues
 to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself; no new knowledge 
can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.

Nate (2014-01-27 12:13): @Phil you got it
Nate (2014-01-27 12:14): although I'd probably use a knife.  Harder to recover from.  Or maybe draino
Nate (2014-01-27 12:14): I'm thinking more twisted than usual.  It's misdirected at whoever wrote this query
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:15): bleach in the eyes is always good
Nate (2014-01-27 12:15): draino is an acid.  Saw it on law and order
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:15): sweet
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:15): "Slut TierThis is the lowest PumpNDump™ and should be treated accordingly. All women you interact with must start at this level. At this stage you are the Dick, and cannot offer anything more untilsheproves herself.
Fling TierThis is your FWB/Fuckbuddy and beside getting Dick she is also getting Time and Effort. She has proven herself worthy of being treated a little better, and now must work to win your commitment."
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:16): "LTR Tier She has won your commitment. For whatever reason, you have deemed her worthy of keeping around. You should be Supportive and reward her for her loyalty. Mold her into the ideal girlfriend by rewarding good behavior. This stage should be treated as a trial period for the next stage."
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:16): "Wife Tier Marriage is incredibly risky for a man. The only reason for a man to get married is to provide a stable family for his children. This should be a woman so outstanding, she deserves the Wallet."
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:16): teirs of pussy
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:17): "Slut Tier - all women start here.
Fling Tier - worthy of just enough effort to fuck them.
Fuck Friend Tier - has shown enough value to be a friend while you fuck them. If the fucking stops the friendship stops."
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:17): "Relationship Tier - trial period for long term partner; do not overly enmesh your life with hers; still be on the lookout for other options.
Long Term Partner Tier - this is the highest tier, reserved for someone worthy of trust. Do not marry."
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:17): that ones good too
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:18): the second one
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:18): although I agree with marriage is to provide stability for potential children
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:18): no other reason to do it
Nate (2014-01-27 12:19): Make sure not to live in a state with common law marriage
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:19): ah yeah
Nate (2014-01-27 12:20): Nothing worse than not getting married, and finding out you're really married with no prenup
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:21): yeaaaa

Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:27): whatever 
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:27): I would never live with a bitch if I wasn't planning on marrying her
Nate (2014-01-27 12:27): I'm never having kids, so I would
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:28): my friend rob was telling me about his quasi red pill beliefs that he developed just by being observant
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:29): he's never even heard of red pill
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:29): he's a smart dude 
Nate (2014-01-27 12:29): We should fix that
Phillatio (2014-01-27 12:30): baseball bats work well for fixing smarties

Phillatio (2014-01-27 18:27): that kind of stuff is always better
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:27): Well, I tried some of that before but it didn't go well

Jimmyayo (2014-01-27 18:32): ^ awesome idea

Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:33): @Phillatio That didn't just involve your roof and your dick

Phillatio (2014-01-27 18:41): that's easy enough
Nate (2014-01-27 18:41): That will guarantee she wants a relationship :)
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:42): She does want a relationship
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:42) (1x <3): There isn't any doubt about that.
Phillatio (2014-01-27 18:42) (1x <3): what do you want
Nate (2014-01-27 18:42): yeah, but going away for a trip together is like a magic signal that it's moved into serious
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:43): She was really pissed that I only hang out with her on weekdays, and that she was only worth a Sunday last week.
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:43) (1x <3): And my lack of responsiveness to her texts.
Phillatio (2014-01-27 18:45): well 
Phillatio (2014-01-27 18:45): if you want to keep her around

Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:47) (2x <3): Nope, he's still to weak from his nap to launch an attack at this moment
Nate (2014-01-27 18:47): Nap aka daytime
Xander Xone (2014-01-27 18:48): As Jimmy pointed out to me yesterday, Katie can keep up with me

Xander Xone (2014-01-27 19:04): I don't wanna go to my date. This always happens
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-27 19:07): Me too.. Its called laziness and commitment (committing to something) 
Nate (2014-01-27 19:08) (1x <3): I'm committing my mind to finding something to eat that requires as little effort on my part as possible
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-27 19:11): Order Pizza

Xander Xone (2014-01-27 19:24): They can basically hole-punch a human with their teeth
Nate (2014-01-27 19:25): and run as fast as a small car
Phillatio (2014-01-27 19:28): they don't change directions well
Phillatio (2014-01-27 19:29): and climb trees

Nate (2014-01-28 12:08): @phil don't call me for bail
Phillatio (2014-01-28 12:09): lol I'm pretty sure I could get away with saying literally anything
Phillatio (2014-01-28 12:09): mostly because I've already done it
Phillatio (2014-01-28 12:09): as long as you say it with a smirk

Xander Xone (2014-01-28 12:55): Yeah, don't try pulling that off unless you're me
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 12:55): �
Nate (2014-01-28 12:55): They hear dumb people making jokes about it all the time.  Every time I've dated a girl much taller it's because I ignored height
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 12:56): It's fine to give them shit for it once you have them hooked
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 12:56): Just like giving them shit for anything else

Nate (2014-01-28 13:18): @jimmy I can't help it if my willpower is awesome sauce
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 13:19): Nate: Can we actually have decent conversation/discussion there?
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:19): I wonder why firefox is so much slower than chrome
Nate (2014-01-28 13:19): On a weekday we can
Nate (2014-01-28 13:20): Fine, I'll let you convince them to go somewhere else.
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:20): I should really make a post on reddit offering my services
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:21): Like Ahmad told me to weeks ago
Nate (2014-01-28 13:21): I'm not sure if they accept advertisements
Nate (2014-01-28 13:21): unless you want to actually advertise
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:21): I mean, depends on the subreddit
Nate (2014-01-28 13:21): yeah
Nate (2014-01-28 13:22): well if you want hopeless go to askseddit
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:22): It might be against the seddit or gothamseddit rules
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:22): Oh man... I don't know if I can take absolutely hopeless..
Nate (2014-01-28 13:22): it's actually pretty damn cheap to advertise on a subreddit
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:22): I enjoy having Ross Nolan as a client because he isn't a complete idiot
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:23): I couldn't do much for Sanderp
Nate (2014-01-28 13:23): Most of the ppl you find will be pretty hopeless
Phillatio (2014-01-28 13:24): well one thing I learned is hopeless people shouldn't be out approaching 
Phillatio (2014-01-28 13:24): they have bigger things to worry about
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:24) (1x <3): I couldn't really take Sanderp's money in good conscience
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:25) (2x <3): Imagine that, me having a conscience
Nate (2014-01-28 13:25): You've been hanging out with me too much Xander
Phillatio (2014-01-28 13:26): don't worry I have even less of a conscience than both of you
Phillatio (2014-01-28 13:26): there's always one level deeper
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:26): Probably. I have been rediscovering my romantic side as of late
Nate (2014-01-28 13:26): katie :)
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:27): Yeah. Even that chick from last night was really cool

Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:31): From so far away. I suppose it's worth as hot
Nate (2014-01-28 13:31): You have something better to do than try?
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:31) (1x <3): *a shot
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 13:32): Not really. All I need is $500 and grocery money per month while I dick around figuring out what I want to do

Nate (2014-01-28 17:09): My friends call me Xander, you can call me Bob
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 17:12): I just imagined Ltd going "My friends call me Ltd, but you can call me daddy."
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 17:13) (1x <3): And then the girl running away
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 17:25): http://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1url9m/how_to_inspire_protective_and_manly_feelings/
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 17:34): I don't think anyone even knows what the hell I'm talking about in GayLife
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 17:51): Okay, hating GayLife again

Phillatio (2014-01-28 18:04): What's a cheap bar in Chelsea
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 18:06) (1x <3): Not Buddakan's
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 18:22) (1x <3): OMG MARK CAN U STOP EATING
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 18:23): Mmm, that chicken was good
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-28 18:31): It run with the name
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 18:37): Pretty excited about my date tonight, cute as a fucking button
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 18:37): @Jimmyayo Are you gonna try to get in state?
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 18:37): I hope you don't get blown out while doing so
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 18:40): Hahahahaha
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 18:41): Gonna do some squats to get in state
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 18:41): Peace 
Phillatio (2014-01-28 20:07): Capoeira was fun
Phillatio (2014-01-28 20:08): I flaked on my date. She's not as good looking in her selfie as her tinder pics
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 23:51): Date going well, buybhaveny fucking kissed yet shot
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 23:51): Shit
Jimmyayo (2014-01-28 23:52) (3x <3): I don't care I'm having BBQ w closers tmrw
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 23:54) (1x <3): Date going well. Making out at Berry Park. She's cuter than her photos
Xander Xone (2014-01-28 23:54) (3x <3): Ahmad already bounced with his amazon woman to her place. Good show!
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 00:14) (1x <3): Date ended. She has work early in the morning. Possibly could have pushed it further but whatever. Built a lot of attraction. She seems into me, will likely see her again
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 00:21) (2x <3): Aaaaand Ahmad has my apartment keys. Guess I might as well go to the Levee and try to SNL some girl there and keep drinking
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 00:34): Mmm, sportsman special at Levee
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 01:17) (1x <3): Fuck this
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 02:21): She has a bf.. .
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 09:08): So we were hanging out at my apt, we were kissing and making out but she got major lmr cuz her stupid loser bf
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 09:09): She apologized like crazy , I tried my best to just stay nonreactive. Told her that's cool but that I don't like girls who play games. She started getting defensive and saying she wants to escalate more but she can't blah blah
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 09:12): At one point I grabbed her and straddled her on my lap facing me, told her to shut the fuck up lol. That despite what she says, her eyes told me that she wanted me. When I pulled her in for another make out she was jamming her tongue in my mouth , ears. But after 2-3 min the ASD reared its obnoxious head again
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:04): Oh no...
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:09): Sounds like an utter waste of time
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:14): Yeah we'll see. She texted last night:

"Just got in. I really had fun today, Thank you oppa. Now you can sleep :) "  

(OP's note: oppa is a female's term of endearment towards a male in Korean)
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:14): Oppa Gangnam style
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:14): Exactly
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:15): Mmm, girl last night was delicious
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:15): Blondie?
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:15): Yes
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:15): Nais
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:16): Must... bone...
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:16): Mine too.  Turns out she was a ballet dancer till 3 yrs ago
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:17): Nice tight body
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:17): She was an 8
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:20): Nice to finish my Tindering career with some fly hunnies
Nate (2014-01-29 10:28): Chick morality is like dealing with a child on a tantrum.  If the boyfriend actually mattered at all she wouldn't have gone on a date with someone else.  No wonder it's impossible to trust them
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:29): Uhhh, don't forget that there's a good chance she never intends on fucking him
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:29): But desires the extra validation nonetheless
Nate (2014-01-29 10:30): I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:30): She likely already got what she wanted out of Jimmy, which was him showing her how much he wanted her
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:30): She already got off
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:30) (1x <3): Emotional orgasms
Nate (2014-01-29 10:31) (1x <3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_DkwFi9jnQ
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:31): I dunno Xander
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:32) (1x <3): When I freezed her out, she came back like a little puppy "what can i do? what do u want??"
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:32): "What can I do to keep the stream of validation flowing?"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:33): My other FIT chick didn't fuck on the 1st date either, wouldn't come up to the apt, saying "i'm not one of those girls, putting out on first date bla bla"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:33) (1x <3): 2nd date, she shows up w/ a fucking toothbrush packed lol
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:35): Seems like you have a thing for attention whores, Jimbo
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:35): In terms of "intending to fuck" or not - i don't think most chicks have a plan laid out "ok him i'm going to fuck tonight after drinks".  They'll do whatever their emotions/feelings lead them to do at that moment. 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:36): Well I don't go for the most easily bangable slut  ;)
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:36) (1x <3): I like the girls with the plan
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:37): I just woke up by the way
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:38): @Jimmy That's me, always looking for the quick bang no matter what
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:39): With daygame IMO - you have to try and turn almost everything into a bang
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 10:39): Some are easy some are hard
Nate (2014-01-29 10:39): How is that any different than night game?
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:39): IMO you have to try to grin almost everything I to a bang
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:39): Turn*
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:40) (1x <3): Jesus it's hard to type in a moving cab
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:40): Just because I make the bang look easy doesn't mean it's easy
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:41): It doesn't look easy
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:41): Ugh, it's already fag city in here today
Nate (2014-01-29 10:42) (1x <3): Keep up that positive vibe Xander
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:43) (1x <3): I can't help it that the whole world is wrong and I"m the only one who's right
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:44): Lol
Nate (2014-01-29 10:44): Fortunately my browser has this excellent little x button.  Bye!
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:45): See ya
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:45): I don't think I've seen D-money post anything in months
Phillatio (2014-01-29 10:47): He's too busy getting pussy obviously
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 10:49): Too busy commuting to Rack City
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 11:01): Phil... tardy again, I see!
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:02): eah
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:02): yeah*
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:02): I smoked the last of my pot last night
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 11:09): How do you still have a job man
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 11:09): Incredible
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:13): lol I do a really great job
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:13) (1x <3): I mean they fucking love me here. I got a bonus and a raise 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 11:13) (1x <3): and I can come in super late 3 times a week

Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:02): Wait, is Jad a mod now?
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:03): @Phillatio Post pictures of the Tinder bitch you flaked on last night
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:03): Her Tinder pics and the selfie she sent you
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:04): Nop Jad isn't mod
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:04): He's really serious about coaching. I kinda wonder if its to stroke his ego 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:05) (2x <3): There's no wondering about it

Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:10): yeah well 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:10): I fucked up my other date this week by sending that really picture

Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:11): Hehehe
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:12): I think you become too much pull when you're drinking, Jimmy
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:12): Mebbe. Gotta drink less. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:12): You've been getting a little sloppy, haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:13): I definitely drank to excess last night
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:15) (1x <3): Word. If I go out with u gays after dinner tn, I'm not drinking. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:16) (1x <3): Only club sodas for you.
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:16) (1x <3): GayLife is almost bearable now that A B has left the chat
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:17): stop trying to persuade me to rejoin
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 12:18): "you think you are going to get it on the first date" "No, this is our 2nd date, our first was the day we met"
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:22): There is about to be a lot of homo love later tonight
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 12:24): Group bro date

Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:30): Is that better?
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 12:30): We will not bend for phil

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 12:30): Now I will show up at 8 lol
Nate (2014-01-29 12:30): What are people doing for the superbowl?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:31) (2x <3): Apparently the south has a different time zone
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:31): Avoiding anything football related
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:31): I actually want to watch it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:31): Nate I was thinking about that. Would like to go to a pub that isn't fucktastic
Nate (2014-01-29 12:31): @Xan it's the one time of the year I can pretend to care about football
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:31): could be exciting
Nate (2014-01-29 12:32) (1x <3): @jimmy sounds like a good plan
Nate (2014-01-29 12:32): as long as they serve lots of wings
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:32): My three-finger-friend from vancouver will be in town too.  I think I'm gonna just friendzone her. 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:32): beer* for me
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 12:32): Super bowl is that the time where there is a lot of cute girls at bars cheering for a sport they can't play
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:32): More like comprehend
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:32): she can't give you a very good handy with only 3 fingers
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:33): Lol no no - she's the one that, when I started fingering her, said "No James...u gotta use 3 fingers"
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:33) (4x <3): And I was suddenly rushed with feelings of inadequacy 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:34): Eww
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:34): fisting in great

Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:34) (1x <3): Haha man, so many absurd stories doing pickup.  I think I enjoy the stories more than the sex. 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:35) (1x <3): Sex is alright. I enjoy the violation more than the sex
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:35) (1x <3): I think Phil does it for the thrill -

Am I going to get her pregnant???
Am I going to get a STD???
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:36): &gt; Lol whatever fuck condoms
Nate (2014-01-29 12:36) (1x <3): I do it for the feeling of looking down into a girls eyes and seeing total submission, just before I plunge my dick down her throat as far as I can
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:37): You guys are so gross!
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:37) (1x <3): that gave me a chubby
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:37): Sex is weird!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:37): I like sex because it reminds me of porn
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:37) (1x <3): Which gets me off
Nate (2014-01-29 12:37): I like sex because I'm horny all the time and my dick likes to go inside things
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:38): When I start losing my hard on I start thinking about how this could be a porn scene 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:38) (1x <3): I just smoke more pot then ^
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:38): Sex takes too much effort
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:38): kettle ball swings help 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:38): apparently 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:38) (1x <3): I'm content to let her suck me off while I lay back
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:40): Where is mister kettleballs?
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:41): Asian mark
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:41): Dying from the flue
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 12:41): fluuuuuu
Nate (2014-01-29 12:41): Are you sure he didn't OD
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:41): So...he won't make the dinner tonight?  :(
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:41): Haven't seen that chigger in ages 
Nate (2014-01-29 12:42): It's funny the main character in Wolf of Wall Street reminded me of Mark
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:42): Jordan Belfort?!
Nate (2014-01-29 12:42): ya
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 12:43) (1x <3): Haven't seen it yet.  Maybe I should watch that to satiate my lust for Mark
Nate (2014-01-29 12:44): Great movie
Nate (2014-01-29 12:45): Yeah I'm gonna miss Mark.  Gorging on food just isn't the same without him
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:47): Haha we saw wolf on Sunday together
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:47): Doesn't really remind me of him. But a little
Nate (2014-01-29 12:48) (1x <3): A finance guy who does a lot of drugs and fucks alot of women.  Well I guess that's all finance guys..
Nate (2014-01-29 12:50): @phil well mark isn't nearly as crazy as jordan. :)
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:51): Or as many drugs
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:51): Well close
Nate (2014-01-29 12:51): Well to be fair he has enough drugs in his apartment to kill a small african village
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:53): true true
Phillatio (2014-01-29 12:53): I love drugs
Nate (2014-01-29 12:57) (1x <3): I miss Mark

Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:29) (1x <3): @TiMex you don't do that already?
TiMex (2014-01-29 14:29): Haha
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:29) (1x <3): Some people are beyond help
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:30) (1x <3): They exist merely to entertain us, nothing more
Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:31) (1x <3): times were better when you could put them in an arena with a bunch of felines 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:32) (2x <3): That's basically what it is to watch these dudes try to hit on chicks at a bar

Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:49): don't lie, you know you'll show up just to get in line for my roasted sausage 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:49): No one can eat a sausage like I can

Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 14:55): Lol what is it with your obsession with Andres
Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:55): "not something I want to go and participate in at this time"
Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:55): it does sound like something a politician would say
Phillatio (2014-01-29 14:55) (1x <3): whereas I would say.. I don't want to go because Xander's a little shit
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 14:56) (1x <3): Xander
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 14:57) (1x <3): When is your Tinder D-day

Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:57): I effectively stopped swiping over a week ago
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 14:58): I have one more lead that I'm working on. Once I set up a date/get her number, it's done-zo
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 14:58): WORD

Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:05): @Nate So you're next on the chopping block?
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:05): you lost your job
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:05): wtf guys
Nate (2014-01-29 15:05): No they aren't firiing me
Nate (2014-01-29 15:06): They are moving the office to a crappy cubicle farm on 57th st and 11th ave
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:06): oh instead of around the corner 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:06) (1x <3): Seriously, we should all just start a cLosers business
Nate (2014-01-29 15:06): yeah basically
Nate (2014-01-29 15:07): No way am I traveling all that way to sit in a mini-cubicle farm out in the open
Nate (2014-01-29 15:07): Guess I'll update my resume this weekend
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:07): Working remote part of the week is not an option?
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:08): We're people, not cattle!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:08): Moooooooo
Nate (2014-01-29 15:08): I don't think they'd go for 3 days a week, and I don't like this job enough to care
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:08): When's the move?
Nate (2014-01-29 15:09): Theoretically our lease expires on march 1st, but who knows how long it will take them to get their act together.  If I'm lucky it could be months.  If not it could be in a month
Nate (2014-01-29 15:10): The people here move like molasses
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:10) (1x <3): with the market the way it is, you shouldn't need more than a month to get a new job
Nate (2014-01-29 15:10): yeah I don't imagine it will be that hard
Nate (2014-01-29 15:11) (2x <3): I think I'll put all my energy into my startup now while I still have the time
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:15) (1x <3): We're all basically fucked: http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2014/01/29/lost-50000-twitter-username/#!tToG2

Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:28): Dave Hot Tongs is coming to the meatup!
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:28): @Jimmyayo How hard did you have to twist his balls before he submitted
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:29): Nah once they were in my mouth it was pretty easy 
D-money (2014-01-29 15:30) (2x <3): lol thats right, we should have more meetups, that treatment was topnotch
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:32): hopefully I don't confuse you with Jimmy this time
Nate (2014-01-29 15:32): Or Mark, his twin
Nate (2014-01-29 15:33) (1x <3): All you asians look alike
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 15:33): Anyone heard from mark
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:38): I haze
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:38): He isn't going to be attending today, probably because he has the flu
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:38): He claimed to have the flu yesterday
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:38): I would be flattered if that were true, as Dave Midtown moonlights as a magazine print model
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:39): Yes, yes. Why don't we just rename cLosers to model-esque puas
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:39): That'll work
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:39): How bout "Let's play Sick or Fired!"
Nate (2014-01-29 15:39): model-esque puas and lumi
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:40): #WhiningLikeWoman
Nate (2014-01-29 15:40): bitch!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:40): Dude a lot of work goes into looking as good as me 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:40): Slut!
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:40): You don't just roll out of bed looking this incredible 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:40) (1x <3): Slore!
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-01-29 15:40): Mark (Ahmad) changed the group's name to Meatpacking
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:41): Dude, very little work goes into looking like me
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:41): I do
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:41) (1x <3): Step 1 - insert cheese ?
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-01-29 15:41): Mark (Ahmad) changed the group's avatar
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:41) (1x <3): I show up to dates with unshowered and unkempt, with the funk of other women encrusting my crotch
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:41): I actually recoiled a little 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:42): I coiled
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 15:42): Yeah he did. He was saved by the darkness of the room
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-29 15:43): His date spotted me making out with my date
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:43) (1x <3): I like showing up to a date eating a slice of pizza
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:43) (2x <3): Is that why he goes to dive bars, cuz the stench of puke hides the stench of Xander
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:43): It compliments it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:43): Mmmmm
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:44): No, it complements it, Phil. The ladies compliment me on it
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:45): Whatever
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:45): See everyone at 7:30 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:45): Please for fucks sake try not to be so late
Nate (2014-01-29 15:46) (2x <3): Well I sure as hell are not showing up on time.  Last time I stood there for 20 minutes before the first person showed up
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:48): https://twitter.com/SimianOutcast/status/428630201367396352
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:49): I was half an hour late to my date last night and arrived a few minutes after she got there
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:50): I felt like I was going to vomitus a minute ago
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:50): fascinating sensation 
Nate (2014-01-29 15:50) (1x <3): Don't fight it.  You'll have more room for meat
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:50): Where is that little boy with the peacock feather
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:51): oh this place is mad close to me
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:51): awesome 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:51): Phil suddenly turns SF Bay Area on us
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:52) (1x <3): lol mad close?

Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:52): I'll be fashionably early
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 15:52): Fuck u guys

Nate (2014-01-29 15:58): Notice how not a single photo actually shows her body definition
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 15:58): That is truly worrisome
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:59): yeah I'm calling a little chubster on that one
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:59): but its hard to tell
Phillatio (2014-01-29 15:59): look at the thickness of the thighs in the second to last
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:00): The question is, am I willing to roll the dice one last time
Nate (2014-01-29 16:01) (1x <3): *one last time* - heheh
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:01) (1x <3): go for it
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:01) (1x <3): she's got a cute face
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:02): Maybe I'll just get up and leave if she shows up and is obviously chunky
Nate (2014-01-29 16:02): Lemon Law
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:02): We'll watch this place go down in flames only one more time
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:05): Girls are fucking smart.
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:06): If she had a decent body it would be plastered all over her profile
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:06): It's like animal intelligence, though
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:06): Like a lizard
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:06): girls are fucking instinctual*
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:10): I'm listening to the last christian mcqueen podcast
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:10): about wingmen
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:11): Damn, I need to get caught up on those. So entertaining
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:11): this is from 3 days ago
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:11): I'm on number 4 still
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:13): what the fuck dude
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:15): episode 5 is pretty damn good
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:15): 6 is kinda boring to me
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:15): maybe I just wasn't listening carefully enough
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:18): I just made a quantum leap in my facebook stalking skills today
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:21): I doubt any of you other FB users can see this, but I figure I'll give it a try

Nate (2014-01-29 16:23): No I just made up that name out of my head
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:24): I cannot
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:24): @Nate So what's your verdict
Nate (2014-01-29 16:25): Meh
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:25): Somewhere in the 6 range, then
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:25): Whoah, what GayLife idiocy am I missing out on at this moment
Nate (2014-01-29 16:26): Maybe a 6 if I was pretty drunk
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:26): Elaborate
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:26): And you usually are
Nate (2014-01-29 16:26): I just don't find her attractive
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:27): I want Phil to weigh in here
Nate (2014-01-29 16:27): She's slightly overweight.  She looks like she dresses like a hobo half the time
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:28): Someone text/PM Phil and tell him to stop working. He has important shit to do in here
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:28): what 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:28): wut*
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:28): ^ Check out Kat Fry's pictures on FB
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:29): I'd hit her once. but she's probably not worth the effort 
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:29): solid 6. shaky 7
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:30): She would be pretty hot if she lost some pudge
Nate (2014-01-29 16:30): I'd say shes a 5 right now.
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:30): @Nate So something you would definitely hit, then
Nate (2014-01-29 16:30): As I said, only if I was very drink
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:30): I'd hit it sober
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:30): So something you would definitely hit then, most of the time
Nate (2014-01-29 16:31): Not really
Nate (2014-01-29 16:32): Don't take my opinion tho, if you like her, go for it.  We don't always agree on what a girl looks like
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:32): I kinka wanna hit it just because of our mutual friend
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:36): who would be?
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:38): Maddie Campbell, this hipster bitch I'm sort of friends with from college
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:42) (1x <3): mcqueens talking about rolling out solo
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:42): he says its pivotal to developing your game
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:42): made some good points
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:42): I did that last night after my date had to bounce and while Ahmad was occupied with his amazon queen
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:43): how'd that go
Nate (2014-01-29 16:43): Did he actually fuck her?  His comments were ambiguous
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:43): I didn't do much since I was fucking exhausted
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:43): Mainly just sat by myself, played with my phone and ate cheese balls
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:43): I did it in vegas
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:43): Got approached by a 5 and her gay friend
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:43) (1x <3): it's difficult 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:44): Ahmad would have fucked her, but he was suffering from whiskey dick
Nate (2014-01-29 16:44): Ack
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:44): oh no... . ...... .... 
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:44): She's super into him, though, so he definitely will fuck her next time
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:44): noice
Nate (2014-01-29 16:44): Approaching alone isn't difficult as long as you do it a lot
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:44): at night though
Nate (2014-01-29 16:45): Same diff
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:45): Yeah, I used to go out alone all of the time in the bay area
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:45): I got pretty good at it
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:45): well I've never done it
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:45): I should probably try it out
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:45): Now I have become too reliant on wingmen again
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:45): it makes you a better wingman to go out solo
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:50): I believe it
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:51): I love going out solo
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:51): Except sometimes u find yourself in a shitty bar w/ lots of insular groups
Jimmyayo (2014-01-29 16:52): When it sucks it SUCKS
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:53): Having cash is important, especially if you're at dive bars
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:53): That way they don't give you shit about minimums
Xander Xone (2014-01-29 16:53): You can just cut out if it sucks
Phillatio (2014-01-29 16:59): yeaaa

Xander Xone (2014-01-30 12:20) (2x <3): Every cLoser should read this: http://www.examiner.com/article/the-80-20-rule-theory-explains-a-lot-of-today-s-problems-among-dating-singles

Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 12:47): Yay top 20%
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 12:48): &gt;Some men naturally have 'game' and personal charm with women, some men learn how to have it, and some men will never have it. For the latter, sad ... but true.

Phillatio (2014-01-30 12:51): I'd say most men never have game and personal charm with women
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 12:56): I'm reading the articled linked from that article: 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 12:57): http://www.examiner.com/article/when-you-understand-the-madonna-whore-complex-you-pretty-much-understand-men
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 12:58): Have you guys read this?  Thoughts?
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 13:02): I think the Madonna/Whore complex is bunk
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:04): I think, if it is true, a lot more guys than he thinks would fall into the "fully evolved man" 
- that can see a girl both as a good girl and a sex fiend
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 13:05): It has been proven that peers influence children more than their parents, which means that your primary turn ons will likely be derived from those around you
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 13:05): Taking Freud at face value is ludicrous
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:09) (1x <3): taking you at face value is ludicrous mother fucker
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:09): Yep. I know that the first girl I ever liked was when I was 12. She was also 12. 
Hence I like 12 yr olds
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:09): hehehe
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:09): the first girl I liked was in 3rd grade

Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:12): that's her now ^
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:12): she became like a fitness model or some shit
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:12): she wouldn't make out with me in 3rd grade so I broke up with her
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:13): Hot damn
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:13): she looks like a whore
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:13): but she's got a nice body 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:14): I went to a predominantly white school.  Then this new girl comes to school, fresh from Korea and the teacher puts her next to me to help translate and shit.  She was really skinny and pretty.  I'm almost certain that's what shaped my definition of beauty/sexual attractiveness growing up
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 13:18): I'm pretty sure that my genes shaped what I find attractive
Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:19): Your genes...or her jeans
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:25): I'm pretty sure I'm just looking for my mom

Jimmyayo (2014-01-30 13:48) (1x <3): I'm hoping it'll get warm soon enough 
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 13:50): That's not a solution!
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:53): grand central is overrun by PUAs
Phillatio (2014-01-30 13:53): reeeeeally?

Phillatio (2014-01-30 14:04): hmmmmph
Phillatio (2014-01-30 14:04): well people say the same thing about union square
Phillatio (2014-01-30 14:04): but its the best place to day game in my opinion
Nate (2014-01-30 14:06) (2x <3): 1. Even if a girl knows you're picking her up, if she likes you it won't matter
Nate (2014-01-30 14:06) (2x <3): 2. Both places have a shitload of traffic, so there aren't enough guys to make that much of a dent
Phillatio (2014-01-30 14:09): I agree
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 14:09): I just took a sticky shit
Xander Xone (2014-01-30 14:15): I think that it's time for us to begin thinking outside of the box a little in terms of pickup locations

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-30 14:20):  lesbian Bars/Areas: Don’t believe the hype—most lesbian couples consist of a “butch”, who is the REAL lesbian, and a “femme”, who is aCLOSET bisexual, often with some resent toward men. The “femme” needs regular cock to be happy, but has usually been denied access to it by her jealous girlfriend for months, or evenYEARS. The goal is convincing the insecure, penis envy-filled “butch” that your inclusion in their lovemaking will paradoxically stre
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-30 14:20): paradoxically strengthen the relationship and make the “femme” LESS LIKELY to run off with a man. Dimitri The Lover will review exactly how to pull off this highly manipulative seduction maneuver by using strong intimidation tactics and playing the “butch’s” insecurities against herself.

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-30 14:29): Churches/Synagogues/Mosques/Temples:Some of Dimitri The Lover’s most prized conquests were of religious closet sluts in their 20’s and 30’s, including a Rabbi’s wife, a Catholic priest’s daughter, and the deflowering of several Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Phillatio (2014-01-30 15:23) (1x <3): "The church of Dimitri of Later day sluts is based on the belief that one day Dimitri the Lover pelvic thrusted a slut so hard that his cock accelerated back in time and impregnated the virgin Mary. Since Jesus is therefore Dimitri's son yet Jesus is also considered the son of god, Dimitri is a greek god"

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-31 12:18) (1x <3): Xander u met Alex at union pool. He was also at the meatup in meatpacking. I added him to the Gotham group. He is very good but Jad went into all of his sets and fucked them (bc jad is creepy) 
Nate (2014-01-31 12:18): @Mark do you agree he can be unecessarily touchy to guys?
Nate (2014-01-31 12:18): about Jad
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-31 12:19): Yes its a middle eastern thing
Nate (2014-01-31 12:19): ahh
Nate (2014-01-31 12:20) (1x <3): Very middle eastern to grab a guy and dry hump him I guess
Phillatio (2014-01-31 12:20): yeah 
Phillatio (2014-01-31 12:20) (1x <3): well you can't tell if our women are hot

Jimmyayo (2014-01-31 12:26): LOL
Nate (2014-01-31 12:26): Hmm okay the lease is expiring here at the end of march, and they are still 'debating' the move.  Might not be so much of a time crunch.  Still gonna look for new jobs tho.
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-31 12:27): I don't know how to translate this "guys of the street"  - basically low class guys that don't work and spend all their time in the street. They hit on girl in the street (more like sexually harassed) and in their spear time they touch their guy friends. 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-01-31 12:28): *Spare time 
Jimmyayo (2014-01-31 12:28): ohhhhhh

Nate (2014-01-31 12:30): Okay Jad suddenly makes a lot more sense

Phillatio (2014-01-31 12:33) (1x <3): "did you see the bridge on that nose? that's a bridge I'd like to cross"

Nate (2014-01-31 12:50): I was gonna tell AB he should kill himself, but I'm worried he might actually do it

Alpha Overlord (2014-01-31 13:11) (2x <3): these laws apply only to poor people

An expression of higher value: I showed intolerance to passive behavior from a girl I was gonna see tonight who I have been chatting with for a while
I told her if she wants to continue to talk to me, she has to drop her passive attitude because it reminds me of my ex and it leaves a disgusting taste in my mouth
Xander Xone (2014-02-01 15:42): Sounds like the whiniest fucking thing ever

Jimmyayo (2014-02-03 11:39): Nop
TiMex (2014-02-03 12:57) (1x <3): wtf why is it snowing
Jimmyayo (2014-02-03 12:59): Well 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-03 12:59) (4x <3): Snow occurs when cold temperatures transform the water vapour in the atmosphere into the solid state of ice directly without first going through the liquid stage. As soon as the temperature rises up again, the snow melts back into liquid water.
TiMex (2014-02-03 13:00): haha
Phillatio (2014-02-03 13:00): thanks weather man!

Nate (2014-02-04 09:34) (1x <3): Well stop drinking and the song is awesome
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-04 09:36): I didn't drink last night, but I'm always dehydrated
Nate (2014-02-04 09:36): drink more water then :)
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-04 09:36): I Drunk 6 cups of water before I went to sleep

Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:49): �
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:49): I had a pleasant evening
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:50): was there intercourse involved
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:50): I like Australians for some reason
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:50): And no there wasn't but definitely next time with her
Nate (2014-02-04 09:51) (1x <3): @Phil I know it's not because they are wild and fun.  Can't be that
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:51): bunch of convicts, whole lot of em
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:52): And hilarious. Every freakin one of them
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:52): I've never met a dull Aussie
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:52): So it was fun shooting the shit wid her. And I could tell by her kissing that's she's good in bed
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:53): What is above us in the atmosphere is daily simplified into one or another of those icons beloved of weather forecasters, which, in their naive reductiveness, stand in relation to the subtleties of the sky rather as news reports stand in relation to the complexities of existence
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:54) (1x <3): That's a bit much for pre noon
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:54): are you in the office today
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:55): Not yet
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:56): Zinbarg argues that fear is a prerequisite for bravery; if a man runs into a burning house to save someone without feeling any fear, he writes, it’s not really a brave thing to do.
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 09:56): His hypothetical man’s name is Jim, and in explaining Jim’s behaviour, Zinbarg writes: “Two possibilities that come to mind are either that Jim exhibited a lack of intelligence or that he didn’t perceive danger in this situation.” Not only is it not brave not to be afraid, it may actually mean that you’re dumb.
Phillatio (2014-02-04 09:58): That's probably true
Jimmyayo (2014-02-04 10:08): Jim :(
Phillatio (2014-02-04 10:09): Oh the other thing I liked about phoebe was her DD's
Phillatio (2014-02-04 10:09): Forgot about those
Phillatio (2014-02-04 10:13) (1x <3): Jim would probably have great club game. No AA little intelligent converse needed
Phillatio (2014-02-04 11:16): definitely NSFW definitely hilarious http://i.imgur.com/TG4gADT.gif

Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:02): blue pill example of the day
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:02) (1x <3): what an idiot 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:06) (1x <3): first mistake: getting married
Nate (2014-02-04 12:06): second mistake: to that woman
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:13) (1x <3): well we might disagree on the marriage thing. but his biggest mistake is choosing a woman over his own mission. and fuck 150 miles. that's not that far 
Nate (2014-02-04 12:14): yeah make that bitch drive
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:14): No point in getting married if she truly loves you. You think that the State's sanction (chains) are going to help keep her hypergamy in check?
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:15): I would only get married to have children
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:16): Whatever
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:16): so I would only get married to a woman who I deemed worthy of my genetics
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:16): dont tell me you think love exists xander
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:16): Love does exist, if we're talking about chemical reactions
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:16): Not in any sort of transcendent sense
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:16): ok as long as were talking about in the transient sense and not the disney sense
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:17): Closest thing to a Disney type of love is to create an alpha widow
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:17): marriage serves the purpose of societal obligation because god knows love doesnt last that long
Nate (2014-02-04 12:18): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsmUOdmm02A
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:18): girls can definitely love the way they feel around you and the way you make them feel. They can love the idea of you but they can't love you
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:18): Well, I'll take my chances being single
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:18): to each his own
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:18): That way, if I'm wrong, I won't get fucked in the ass by divorce papers and alimony
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:19): if i get married, im marrying for money, fuck it
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:19) (2x <3): If I get married, it will be because an alien parasite has hijacked my central nervous system
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:20): haha
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:21): so you're saying give you a hefty dose of gamma radiation if you get married 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:21): but the kids thing yeah, thats a big reason for marriage
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:21): i would like to make clones of myself one day so society can benefit
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:21): But society wouldn't benefit, because they all would also go their own way

Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:22): dats nice 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:22): i would teach my kids white collar crime
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:22): When I'm that old, I want to be euthanized
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:22): sorta rather have this

Nate (2014-02-04 12:23): @Xander they drove cross country last year.  And still go out dancing
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:23) (4x <3): i want to die alone in my west village apartment with a syringe stuck to my arm
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:23): Like a Real Man
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:23): a true master of men
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:26): "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide." - Albert Camus
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:27): more like a solution
Nate (2014-02-04 12:28): a final solution
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:28): The Big Sleep
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:28): Sleep, those little slices of death, how I loathe them.
Nate (2014-02-04 12:28): Drinking the Cool Aid
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:30): I'd much rather live forever 
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:30): In a state of constant agony
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:31): Like being transported to the Hellraiser dimension
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:31): Where your skin is continually flayed from your body as you lie there, unable to die
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:32): In fact, the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum physics implies that such a universe does exist, where all life is subjected to never-ending torment
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:33): you'd probably get used ot it
Nate (2014-02-04 12:33) (1x <3): There's also a world where I'm continually pleasured by unending orgasms from gorgeous woman
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:33): @Nate That's true
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:33): phil is right, there is no such thing as continual joy or torment
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:34): Only because of the body's built in feedback mechanisms
Nate (2014-02-04 12:34): Maybe for you
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:34): i understand neuroscience too much to believe in that folly
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:34) (1x <3): In another universe, there may very well be organisms who experience perpetual cascades of bliss or pain
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:35): @Alpha And I understand it better than you
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:35): probably 
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:35): It's merely a quirk of evolution that we have inhibitory mechanisms in place, since it isn't beneficial to be stimulated forever more
Nate (2014-02-04 12:35): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:35): if we're assuming there's infinite universes than anything you can imagine exists 
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:35): Useful in terms of evolution
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:36) (1x <3): this whole conversation is moot because everything can everything
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:36): and you can't be sure of anything 
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:36): except your own existence
Nate (2014-02-04 12:36): I can't be sure of my physical existence
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:36): You could engineer a human without those mechanisms
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:37): With enough master of neuroscience and genetics
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:37): mastery
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:37) (1x <3): They probably would end up being some weird kind of vegetable, but whatever
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:37): well I'm sure you could engineer mostly anything. make a dude with penises all over his body
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:37): Since they would be trapped in a sort of infinite loop
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:37): i like where your heads at phil
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 12:38): how would you like to start up a genomics company
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 12:38): My credentials are near zero
Nate (2014-02-04 12:38) (1x <3): We can finally have a 3 boobed woman.  
Nate (2014-02-04 12:39): Total Recall set very high expectations for the future
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:39): well apparentely depriving people of oxygen makes 3 titted mutants
Nate (2014-02-04 12:40): Let's all choke women!
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:40): I choked a bitch last night
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:40): up against one of those security gates
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:42): these are some of my favorite things
Phillatio (2014-02-04 12:43): a lack of food and nicotine makes a nigga feel mad weird

Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:38) (1x <3): Give me the car on the right any day
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:38): That's my future pimp mobile
Nate (2014-02-04 13:39) (1x <3): Timex that's the Veyron.  It's about 12 times more expensive than an R8 and the greatest car ever built
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:39): I know what it is
Nate (2014-02-04 13:39): I know
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:39): The R8 is probably a better car
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:40): Not as powerful
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:40): But still
Nate (2014-02-04 13:40): You can't do 255mph in an R8...
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:40): You can also drive longer than 10 min
Nate (2014-02-04 13:41): well you can drive longer if you don't drive quite that fast :)
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:41): Plenty of other cars do 250
Nate (2014-02-04 13:41): Not many have air con and a sat nav
Nate (2014-02-04 13:42): and a stereo
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:42): Lol
TiMex (2014-02-04 13:43) (1x <3): If I was to have choice of any car for free. With condition that I could not sell it. Veyron would not make top 10
Nate (2014-02-04 13:44): My #1 for that would be an Aston Martin
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:44) (1x <3): id take the car on the right any day of the week
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:45) (1x <3): the one the left is a gaudy, tasteless poor excuse of a car

Nate (2014-02-04 13:45): It's on my bucket list to max out a veyron
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:46): good thing i live in the city
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:46) (1x <3): otherwise, id go poor with all the money id spend on cars
Nate (2014-02-04 13:47): I miss driving
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:47) (2x <3): so does phil
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:48): ZING
Nate (2014-02-04 13:48): There is nothing like the feeling of passing another car going 80mph faster than they are
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:49) (4x <3): or ramming into a family of four while spinning wildly out of control
Nate (2014-02-04 13:49): I used to take perverse pleasure in scaring the shit out of girls drifting around turns
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:52) (2x <3): I don't need to be in a car to ram a family of four, if you know what I mean
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:57): Man, the Bay Area Seddit groupme is as much of as clusterfuck as Gotham
Nate (2014-02-04 13:57): Are you shocked.  This is the kind of guys that this world attracts
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 13:58): Not at all shocked. These things are more of a continuing revelation.
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 13:58) (1x <3): adverse selection

Nate (2014-02-04 14:24): The hot chick at my office is ranting to someone else in my office because one of the ugly guys called her attractive in public.  "It's so creepy".  lol women
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 14:25): @Nate Who the fuck cares. She just wants more attention by even talking about it
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 14:25): My response: "Guess he had low standards."
Nate (2014-02-04 14:26): I don't care.  I just can't not hear it because it's so loud
Nate (2014-02-04 14:26): It's just funny in a pathetic way because if he was attractive she wouldn't care
Nate (2014-02-04 14:27): She is a big attention whore.  One of the reasons I started ignoring her
Nate (2014-02-04 14:28): I'm quite certain her cock carousel is a long list
Nate (2014-02-04 14:28): Most because she implied it talking to me :)
Nate (2014-02-04 14:48): Dammit all the drama stopped.  Now I actually have to focus on work.

Jimmyayo (2014-02-04 21:55): :(
Xander Xone (2014-02-04 22:03): You don't get as much choice in online dating

Alpha Overlord (2014-02-04 22:36) (3x <3): try this: get up and leave
Nate (2014-02-04 22:39) (2x <3): Just do what girls do.  Say you need to get up early in the morning and it's late
D-money (2014-02-04 23:08) (1x <3): Hooked up with coworker. Interesting thing happened.. At one point she said "I can't go further, like, we're you interested in me? And I say, "...I don't know!" And from then all resistance came down. It's like once she knew it was just for fun she was cool with it, but had she thought there were other prospects then she would have thought too much
Phillatio (2014-02-05 00:14) (1x <3): As I'm getting drunker she's getting better
Phillatio (2014-02-05 00:14): Starting to see what I liked on sat
Nate (2014-02-05 00:15): http://media.ebaumsworld.com/picture/kittyno/BeerGoggles.png
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 00:22): Oh that chick. 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 00:22): She wasn't cute 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 00:42): She was  okay
Phillatio (2014-02-05 00:42): But I won't see her again
Phillatio (2014-02-05 10:22): I haven't left my bed yet. I'm trying to decide if it's worth it
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 10:41): not worth it
Nate (2014-02-05 10:42): It was one giant obstacle course getting to work
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 10:44) (1x <3): my poor allen edmonds
Nate (2014-02-05 10:54): I wore the shoes I don't care about

Xander Xone (2014-02-05 11:03): duck boots
Nate (2014-02-05 11:04): You'd be better off with a boat right now
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:29): well I made it to work
Nate (2014-02-05 11:30): Congrats!

Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:40): lol 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:41): "when I think of asses, women's asses, something comes out of me"
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 11:41): he still is
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 11:41): al pacino never married
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 11:44): http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1x0gln/the_five_stages_of_red_pill_and_how_to_read_rtrp/
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:51): I read that 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:53): it seems pretty self evident but I'm not sure everyone goes through those stages
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:53): maybe someone who's severely plugged in e.g. a white knight or lesser beta 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:53): /omega
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 11:54): Depends on ur history u may or may not
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:54): yeah well I consider myself well on the way to acceptance 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 11:55): Phil I don't know about that
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 11:55): But you are close to something 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:55): well I don't know about it either. but I definitely not denying or angry about anything
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 11:56): I think you are denying it. 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:57): you can think what you want
Phillatio (2014-02-05 11:59): the thing is I never was far from a red pill view of women before I ever had heard of it
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:00): Every time you meet a girl you like, you get stuck. Stuck thinking she is THE ONE to a point where you stop seeing other girl or flaking on them. 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:00): lol nah that's not really true
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:01): phils not really like that in my experience
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:01): I mean its interesting to see your perspective on it based on what I've told you and all that 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:02) (1x <3): I'm not saying there isn't a small part of me that I have to resist from that tendency. but I have never stopped seeing other women because of a particular woman  
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:02): I flake because I don't like bitches
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:03): or I realize they're not worth it and unattractive 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:03) (3x <3): i think phil has no trouble attracting girls, but he might stumble when it comes to transitioning into more relationship-y type game
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:04): Bingo
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:04): and i dont necessarily mean in the monogamous vein
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:04): O gnats, tango.
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:04): So, cat tacos!
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:04): well I've been stuck on that problem for awhile. 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:04): I could be close to breaking through it
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:05): we'll see how february goes
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:05): You have some kind of inner game issue going on
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:05): What this is exactly, I'm not sure
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:05): my advice would be to become more scarce with your time involvement
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:05): even if you have to fake a busy life
Nate (2014-02-05 12:05) (1x <3): (no text) ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/450x278.jpeg.acc7b95070b50131dbfa22000a2d16e3
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:06): I think Phil has been doing a good job as of late with filling up his time with hobbies that he enjoys
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:06): yeah lately 
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:06) (1x <3): It's easier to actually be busy than to fake it
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:06) (1x <3): goddamn banana boys
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:07): Yo, banana boy!
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:07): well the thing is, if you really like a girl, theres a natural tendency to prioritize around her and drop whatever it is keeping you busy to invest in her
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:08) (1x <3): ideally you want to meet more women that you like equally as much, but thats easier said than done
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:08) (1x <3): if you ever feel like a certain girl is a 'catch' then you know your mindset is fucked
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:10) (2x <3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLoRPielarA

Jimmyayo (2014-02-05 12:28) (1x <3): It's safe to cum back now
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:28): Now that's where you're wrong
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:29): I feel bad for bill nye
Nate (2014-02-05 12:29): You mean debating with moronic creationists?
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:32): yeah
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:32): well he didn't do very well

Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:33): fucking gay snow
Nate (2014-02-05 12:33) (1x <3): Well it's hard to argue with someone who thinks the world is 6000 yrs old and their justification is because god is a giant troll
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:34): phil do you even have herb
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:35): I don't actually
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:35): that might be a problem
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:36): well I was gonna buy some
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:36): from your guy
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:36): you want his diggies
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:37): yes
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:37): k
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:41): wait, the universe isn't 6000 years old?
Nate (2014-02-05 12:41): Of course not, it's 36 years old
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:42): I thought it was 37
Nate (2014-02-05 12:42): Nope
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:42) (1x <3): Mr. Solipsist 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:43): youre thinking of our neighboring parallel universe, universe A41923b
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:45): i ate 2lbs of bacon last night because keto, but i actually gained weight
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:45): fucking 2nd law of thermodynamics
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:46): I'm not going to feel sorry for your, fat-ass
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:47): fuck you, im fasting today
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:47): not even hungry
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:47): Haha
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:47): Whats up with the fasting
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:47): (im actually starving)
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:47): Hey Mark u want to come sign tn
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:47): Sing
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:47): if you ate enough calories for 2 days in a single day, you can fast
Nate (2014-02-05 12:48): Well the body doesn't technically work like that
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:48): I eat my weekly intake, everyday 
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:48) (1x <3): Yes, you can fast. Doesn't mean you won't get hungry. What you actually need in terms of calories and what your hunger mechanisms tell you that you want are disjointed
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:49): this girl last night was a molecular biologist Xander
Nate (2014-02-05 12:49): Fasting doesn't automatically lose weight like that.
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:49): Then I probably hate her
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:49): it depends on your glycogen levels nate
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:49): and your food choices pre fast
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:50): Actually, your hunger is based on leptin
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:50): i dont really get hungry during my fasts because meth
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:50): case closed
Nate (2014-02-05 12:50): When you don't eat initially the body tends to try to avoid burning fat.  Takes at least a few days minimum before it gets to that point
Jimmyayo (2014-02-05 12:50): Hm mark what are the best food choices prefast?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:50): nate, your body burns glycogen first, then fat
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:51): so you make sure you dont have any glycogen when you fast
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:51) (1x <3): Emily Swanzey, Dana Cohen, some other cunt whose name I can't remember, they were all molecular bio
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:51) (1x <3): Case closed
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:51): or start the fast with low glycogen
Jimmyayo (2014-02-05 12:51): How do u do that? Workout before fasting?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:51) (1x <3): you can do a glycogen depletion workout yeah
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:52): or just not eat carbs for a few days
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:52): Slow carb diet is the best
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:52): 4 hour body
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:52): Read it
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:52): All of this is well and good, but it would work a lot better without your periodic binging and purging
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-05 12:52): It talks about GI&fasting and other shit
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:52): Then you wouldn't have to be so extreme
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:52): i havent purged in 5 years thank you very much
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:52): Purging includes exercising
Xander Xone (2014-02-05 12:52): Technically
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:53): i dont like eating at work, digestion takes away from focus
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:53): its more of a schedule thing
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:53): ideally, id eat every 3-4 hrs
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-05 12:54): moral of story, bacon is delicious but not a good keto food because its too calorie dense and not very filling
Jimmyayo (2014-02-05 12:54): Noted
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:54): mmmm 
Phillatio (2014-02-05 12:54) (1x <3): I love bacon

Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:29) (1x <3): Use the Xander System if you actually want to get laid
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:30): Otherwise, keep the trolling going since it's entertaining to me
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:31): yeah this wont get you laid but its quite amusing
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:32): itll work for certain people, but your profile, personality, and everything else have to be perfectly aligned
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:32): chicks can pick up on any sort of mask youre wearing
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:33): Lucky for me I don't wear a mask

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 14:37): Oh OK 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:37) (1x <3): i should make a fake okc account and just troll to get it out of my system
Nate (2014-02-06 14:37): Damn you wasted a perfectly good opportunity to reply with "I'm looking for a hole.  I see you have plenty"

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 14:39): Chicks on Okc r crazy
Nate (2014-02-06 14:40): I texted something like that to a chick I number closed once.  She called me and raged.  It was funny.
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:40): Chicks are retarded
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:40): They assume me from time to time
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:41) (1x <3): double barabcoa meat mmmmmmm
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:42): way better than pussy
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:43): on my date on tuesday I was so sick of her I said lets get something to eat. we went to vinny's and i proceeded to eat a few slices like a pig
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:43): while she ate nothing
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:43): fun fun
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:43) (1x <3): Only somewhat socially maladjusted behavior
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:43): kick that bitch to the curb
Phillatio (2014-02-06 14:45) (1x <3): I should have went to chipotle
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:45) (2x <3): first person to come to my place gets a free fistful of addy
Nate (2014-02-06 14:45): I went to a place that serves quinoa bowls.  kate, peppers, olives, chick peas, tofu, feta cheese, and sweet chili sauce
Nate (2014-02-06 14:45): kale
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:56): I like tofu, too bad soy is garbage
Nate (2014-02-06 14:56): It's fine in moderation
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:56): True
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:57): At least the phytoestrogens are broken down in soy sauce
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 14:57): Manbooooooobzzzzz
Nate (2014-02-06 14:57): You have to eat a whole lot of tofu to make any dent in your estrogen levels
Nate (2014-02-06 14:57): Like for every meal only tofu
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:58): Yeah, but vegans and some vegetarians do that
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:58): And those slanty-eyed Japs
Nate (2014-02-06 14:58): Well sucks to be them.  A couple times a week is healthy tho
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:58): Just like my cock in your mouth
Nate (2014-02-06 14:59): cover tofu in garlic, scallions, and hot peppers, pan fry.  drizzle soy sauce
Nate (2014-02-06 14:59): heaven
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 14:59) (1x <3): why have tofu when you can have meat
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 14:59): Why have meat when you can eat my meat
Nate (2014-02-06 14:59): takes the flavor better

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:06): Look what I found
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:07): I like that article
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:07) (1x <3): except replace prayer with meditation
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:07): He already said that
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:07): oh I skimmed it 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:08): Phil too AdD
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:08) (1x <3): replace mediation with LSD
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:08) (1x <3): Also gratitude journals have been proven to help people
Nate (2014-02-06 15:09) (1x <3): gratitude journals?  sounds gay
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:09): Who wants to be mentally healthy? Not me
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:13): It's gay sounding but true in my experience
Nate (2014-02-06 15:13): I don't know what they are
Nate (2014-02-06 15:13): and I'm too lazy to look right now
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:14): Just a list of things that you are grateful for 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:14): Doesn't have to be elaborate 
Nate (2014-02-06 15:14): I'm grateful for my quinoa lunch.  Shit is tasty
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:14) (1x <3): People who write these down have been found to be generally happier and less stressed
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:15): makes sense
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:15): In a similar vein, occasionally writing down goals you want to achieve, no matter how fantastical, makes you more likely to reach them
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:15): The whole visualization thing
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:15): there's not a hell of a lot of things I'm grateful for 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:15): @Phil Then you haven't thought it through enough
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:15) (3x <3): lets join hands and sing kumbaya 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:15) (1x <3): Room over your head, food in your belly etc.
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:15): hahahaha @Mark
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:16): Not being deformed
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:16): At least, not yet, since I haven't gotten to you yet
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:16): being physically gorgeous 
Nate (2014-02-06 15:16) (1x <3): I'm grateful to be smarter than 99% of the people in the world at least
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:16): I'd say that for anyone in this group ^
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:16): It's good to write down both.  Only write down goals but not accomplishments/current blessings and you feel like an unaccomplished little shit. 

Only write down things youre grateful for but no goals, and you just become complacent
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:16): we're all a bunch of smart cookies
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:16): Intelligence is only one component. There are plenty of miserable high IQ folk
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:17): One component of a rich life, that is
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:17): I'd rather not be smarter.. pretty sure I would be insane if I was
Nate (2014-02-06 15:17): I am insane
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:17): They're probably more susceptible to being miserable.  The ignorant are blissful afterall
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:17): It's good to be smart, but being too smart creates alienation
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:17): id rather have high EQ than IQ
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:18): IQ is not very useful in the real world
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:18): to a certain extent
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:18): Having EQ is def better than having ED
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:18): :(
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:18): I have been increasing my EQ steadily for the past two years
Nate (2014-02-06 15:18): I've got the IQ, not the eq yet
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:18): I'm approaching the point where I can play people like a fiddle
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:18): you need high EQ to be a true psychopath anyway
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:19): Have u guys read that EQ book?
Nate (2014-02-06 15:19): title?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:20): reading a book on EQ, oh the irony
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:20): Well, you can't exactly mindmeld
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:23): Wheeeee, scored two free chairs. I'm a happy camper

Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:26): what is that like from the 80s or something
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:26): from my acid trip
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:33): @Jimmyayo GoL was being a nigger, so he got booted
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:34): Cuz he said blow me? 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:34): It's setting a bad precedent
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:34): Its just a chat, why are people taking it so seriously 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:35): It's for logistics. Any amount of noise shall not be tolerated
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:35): Just as in BAS Logistics
Jimmyayo (2014-02-06 15:35): If it gets out of hand and real logistical chat gets lost, we'll do something about it.

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:39): Found in Gotham Logistics 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:39): Previous known as tomorrow and then some
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:41) (1x <3): Worst name for a chat ever
Nate (2014-02-06 15:41): Especially because most logistics will be today and not tomorrow
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:42): "and then some" = some extra bullshit people felt like polluting the chat with
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:42): Nate and phil u too left that group. So if you ever want to rejoin.. Just rejoin like any other group
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:42): *two

Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:42): Is this real life?
Nate (2014-02-06 15:42): I almost never handle my logistics like that.  I chat here or text people
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:43): Like I said, Gotham Logistics is basically just a chat for alerting Closers which venues to avoid
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-06 15:44): Free beer..  ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/1080x1920.png.5c2fba00719d0131256c22000ada92aa

Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:44): I'm providing the assrape
Nate (2014-02-06 15:44): Considering that block is pretty much empty.  I think just the assrape
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:46): I'm going to furnish my entire room for free
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:47): bedbugs come free of charge
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:47): Hard for a pair of wooden chairs to have bed bugs
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:48): I already have a bed, just want a box spring and bed frame
Nate (2014-02-06 15:49): The box spring is what you should be reaaaaaaaly careful with
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-06 15:49): those suckers can hide in anything
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:50): Ruh roh
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:50): Perhaps I should look for a frame that doesn't require a box spring
Phillatio (2014-02-06 15:51) (1x <3): cinder blocks work well 
Xander Xone (2014-02-06 15:51): lol

Have you heard of some website
Where you can put in a face and it searches the entire internet for it?
Marky Mark
Yeah. But I dont think that works very well. 
It took me 5 secs to find her
Enjoy.
Ben M
Just out of curiosity
\
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 00:22): How exactly did you do that?
Marky Mark
You will have to buy my product ;)

Xander Xone (2014-02-07 00:23): Hahaha
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 00:23): Ben M

I'm asking for you to search and see if you find anything like that from her
As an actual favor
Marky Mark

Xander Xone (2014-02-07 00:27): @D-Money I'm not sure what to recommend to you
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 00:29): I suppose I would ask you what books you have read already
D-money (2014-02-07 00:32): I've only read like 3 chapters of the game, some articles online, and watched a few RSD videos

Xander Xone (2014-02-07 02:52) (1x <3): Rape her!
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 09:47): Yall have to see the wall of text PM that Ecstatic sent me last night
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 09:47): Jeebus
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 10:11): Would rather not. He's going manic
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 10:17): Like Jad. Gotham has been overtaken by dudes in the throes of mania
Nate (2014-02-07 10:55): He has some crazy ex that he keeps getting back together with 
Nate (2014-02-07 10:56): Such a waste of energy 
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 10:57): He's a child, 19 years old
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 10:57): I was a complete idiot at that age too
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:03): ugh 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:04): man last night was interesting
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:05): I need to read more about getting over LMR
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:05): I'm pretty sure she threw every single LMR test in the book at me
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:06): "We just met", "I don't do this", blah blah blah
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:08): Basically, you pull back a bit each time for a while and then go back in
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:08): That sucks man. I can't even remember the last time I had LMR
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:10): dude I pulled back and then went back in for 3 hours
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:10): it wasn't gonna happen that night
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:11): Sometimes it just won't. The further you pushed it, the easier it should be the next time
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:11): Her panties should fly off
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:11): I got her high too
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:11): As if of their own accord
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:11): That might have made her paranoid
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:11): mm maybe she seemed more loosened up 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:11): after smoking
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:12): whatever maybe next time .. damn she's got a hot body though
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:12): Phil. How far did u get
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:12) (1x <3): Just the tip
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:12): I was finger banging her on my bed
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:13): Wow, and she still wouldn't have sex
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:13): not for long she kept stopping me
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:13): I never get LMR like that. The few times I've had it, they just won't take off their panties
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:13): And I end up kicking them out
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:13): Yeah. How many times did u go back in
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:13): Or leaving
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:13): 30+
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:14): Lol 
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:14): He counted each time
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:14): lol 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:14): How long each time
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:14): dude common I wasn't taking notes
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:14): Haha
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:14): Funny. 
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:15) (1x <3): Let's consult the records
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:15) (1x <3): videography 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:16): I like her though 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:16): things flow very naturally 
Nate (2014-02-07 11:17) (3x <3): Let's go to the videotape.  As you can see here, phil made it 5 yards, but was just short of the down due to a last minute push back from the defenders
TiMex (2014-02-07 11:18): Lol nice

TiMex (2014-02-07 11:22): Hah yea it is
TiMex (2014-02-07 11:22): Rides only up to 20$ hmm
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:22): Hallelujah!
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:25): Did AB leave yet
Nate (2014-02-07 11:25) (1x <3): umm that'll get you to about half way across the bridge.
Nate (2014-02-07 11:26): I was gonna chase AB off, but I don't feel he's worth the minimal energy required to do it
Nate (2014-02-07 11:26): I just don't open the chat when he's there
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:27): but he's always there
Nate (2014-02-07 11:27): Now you're getting it
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:27): how do you deal with LMR Nate
Nate (2014-02-07 11:27): Poorly
Nate (2014-02-07 11:28): When I have gotten over lmr though I said a lot of things like "I don't know why, but I feel very comfortable when I'm with you"
Nate (2014-02-07 11:28): "It's like we've known each other for years"
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:29): A B and Jad both left 
Nate (2014-02-07 11:29): NIIIICE

TiMex (2014-02-07 11:29): A b left earlier this week
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:29): Ben and GOL are next
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 11:30): I got both of them to leave Gotham Logistics 
TiMex (2014-02-07 11:31): A b still there though
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:31): I like that Nate.. I need to read some LMR destroying material 
TiMex (2014-02-07 11:31): Talking about spamming shit
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:32): Yeah, LMR is always indicative of the comfort stage needing to be worked on more
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:33): right 
Nate (2014-02-07 11:33): I have trouble with comfort because I'm very bad at opening up to girls about myself
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:34): yeah I told her a bunch of stuff about me
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:34): but I took forever to do it
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:37) (1x <3): ah man this girl was as bald as a newborn baby too 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:38): and could freakin wear heels 
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:38): I kept thinking about how its nice to meet a feminine girl
TiMex (2014-02-07 11:39) (1x <3): Lol stop going out with hipsters :D
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:40): There are plenty of feminine hipsters
Phillatio (2014-02-07 11:41): not as many I think
Nate (2014-02-07 11:41): I like my women to smell like flowers and taste like strawberries
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:41): Meh, whatever
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 11:41): Bang bitches, it ain't that hard
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 12:09): Hey Phil, can I temporarily stash two chairs at your place tonight
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 12:13) (1x <3): Ahmad has been reduced to watching commercials for entertainment.
Phillatio (2014-02-07 12:13): uhh yeah
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 12:14): Wheeeeee
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 12:14): Picking up 2 chairs in East Village at 6:30
Nate (2014-02-07 13:13): Felt like smacking kareem down
TiMex (2014-02-07 13:13) (1x <3): yea his statement was full of crap
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 13:17) (1x <3): Correction, Kareem is the A B of BAS
Nate (2014-02-07 13:17): He's using 'I'm cynical' when he really means "I'm a pussy"
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 13:17) (2x <3): By the way, it pisses me off that I have to add a space between "A" and "B"
Nate (2014-02-07 13:17) (2x <3): I've never once added the space
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 13:18): But what if there's an "AB" already in the realm of the forms
Nate (2014-02-07 13:18): Then he should change his name so he's not associated with idiots
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 13:19) (1x <3): what are all u c LOSERZdoing tn
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 13:19): Wait I thought you liked Kareem xander
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 13:19): Xanderr doesnt like anyone
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 13:20): For championing redpill theories when ur busy getting anally penetrated by a block of cheese
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-07 13:20): he only uses me 
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 13:20): He's alright, just gets annoying sometimes
Nate (2014-02-07 13:24): Well he picked a fight with me, otherwise I barely notice him
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 14:54): Ahmad I'll definitely be out later 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-07 14:55): Not sure tmrw, if weather permits I will

TiMex (2014-02-07 16:31): ecstatic posted nsfw pic
TiMex (2014-02-07 16:31): people yelled at him for it
TiMex (2014-02-07 16:31): he did it again to prove how "alpha" he is
Nate (2014-02-07 16:31): My first time leaving gaylife :)
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 16:32): Fucktard
Nate (2014-02-07 16:33): he made it worse by saying he wasn't working and wanted to wack off
Xander Xone (2014-02-07 16:33): Lol at banks raging

Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:28): yes yes and yes
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:29) (1x <3): i just woke up, go me
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:42): "If you're getting nervous or antsy about the interaction (cuz she is above ur league) "
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:42): league theory.... great andre 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:43): Nah the point is your mindset (and game) is going to be different for a 6 vs a 9
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:43): I can game a 6 and treat her like shit, not afraid to lose her
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:43): Different for a 9
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:43): sure
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:43): the idea of leagues is a really bad mindset
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:44): no one, NO ONE is out of my league
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:44): If that were a real truth in your heart and mind, you have entitlement nailed down well
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:44): It's hard tbh
Nate (2014-02-11 11:44): No kidding
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:45): My biggest inner game hurdle is entitlement
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:45): well I have other bigger hurdles to overcome
Nate (2014-02-11 11:45) (1x <3): Treating a brazilian model the same as a boring receptionist ain't easy
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:45): well sure
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:45): I just don't think she's out of my league
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:46): I could get her and if I don't get her I did something wrong 
Nate (2014-02-11 11:46): I more think of it as out of my skill leve
Nate (2014-02-11 11:46): l
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:46): like ^
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:47): Don't you think you/we have been in this long enough to the point where it's not about knowledge or skill level
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:47): And more about inner game, attitude?
Nate (2014-02-11 11:47): I consider inner game to be part of my skill level
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:47): for me it was always way more about skill level
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:48): than inner game
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:48) (1x <3): I don't have enough practice to enter flow states easily 
Nate (2014-02-11 11:49): Well I still get bothered by being uglier than everyone... My inner game definitely needs more work
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:49) (2x <3): club them to death and rape them on the street
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:50): hey mark 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:50): I wanntttttttttt SEX
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:50): I NEEEEEEED SEX

Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:51): agreed 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:53): next time I'm gonna stare into your eyes for 10 minutes
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:53): with longing 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 11:54): How's acting class going?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:54): its been great for our relationship
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:54) (1x <3): i felt him up when the teacher turned off the lights
Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:55): so did the teacher
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:56): she tried to set you up with timex jr
TiMex (2014-02-11 11:57): eh?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:57): hi
TiMex (2014-02-11 11:57): mini me?

Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:57): we found him
TiMex (2014-02-11 11:58): where is this?
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 11:58): at the intersection of destiny and fate

Phillatio (2014-02-11 11:59): lol 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:00): @Nate take a look at that 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:00): I've seen that 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:00): before
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:01): For "ascribed": age, IQ, nationality, height, looks

Looks is only one of 5 ascribed attributes
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:02): And besides Ascribed, there are two other entire categories where men derive our SMV: External and Learned
Nate (2014-02-11 12:14) (2x <3): I know looks are only a part.  It's still frustrating to have girls go right up to other guys solely because of looks.
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:15): you just have to be more proactice 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:16): proactive*
Nate (2014-02-11 12:17): Well I just have to have much better game than good looking guys.  It just means its 5x as hard to get the same results, but I can get the same results
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:20): well you do
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:20): have much better game
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:20) (1x <3): Girls _rarely_ go right up to other guys solely based on looks - unless the guy is ridiculous good looking or the girl is old/ugly
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:21): or it depends on the venue too
Nate (2014-02-11 12:22): Well I see it happen with certain ppl in this chat at the least
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 12:22): Jimmy it happens more than u think
Nate (2014-02-11 12:22): it may not be something you notice because you're used to it
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:22): "certain people"
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 12:23): I want food. 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:23): I wanntttttt PUSSY
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:23) (1x <3): I can't speak to using passive "good looking guy game" - but what's the point of even talking about that
Nate (2014-02-11 12:24): We were talking about it only because it came up in the convo
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:24): It's self-defeating to focus on it is all i'm sayin bro
Nate (2014-02-11 12:25): I agree with you.  That's why I said I noticed it, and have inner game work to do as a result 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:25) (1x <3): :D
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:25) (1x <3): :D
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:25): I've felt pretty unattractive most of my life cuz I was a fucking fatass 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:26): i hear ya, i feel fat
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:26): :::::::::D
Nate (2014-02-11 12:26): I feel unattractive right now because I'm a fatass
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:26): Ok mister manorexic
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:26): i need to get down to 8-10% bf, im at like 15 right now
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:27): I'm like at 18 now
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:27): I need to get down to 13 
Nate (2014-02-11 12:27) (1x <3): My stomach bounces
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:27): Lol
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:27): im eating only almond butter
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:28): and i dont think its working
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:29): Needs more bacon
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:29): i cant do any more fasting
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:30): im starting to think its just glamorized starvation
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:31): ive also never met any intermittent fasting proponents who looked really fit
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:31): It might just be the way you do it Mark. There's a balanced way to do IF I'm sure 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:31): I forgot to fast yesterday
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:32): yeah i cant avoid eating 5lbs of bacon at the end of my fast
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:32): whatever, ill just get hooked up on an IV drip of almond butter
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:32): http://eatstopeatnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fd812c.jpg
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:32): shopped 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:33): just kidding I don't really know
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:33): IF works probably, but i think its not good for most people because of low adherence rates
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:34): But isn't it easier to adhere to than other diets? I always thought that was part if the draw
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:34): yeah thats what i thuoght too in the beginning
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:34): that's why I like it
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:34): but i was wrong
Phillatio (2014-02-11 12:34): I'm gonna fast tomorrow
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:35) (1x <3): im gonna enjoy torturing you
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:35): Have u tried other diet programs that you've found were easier to stick to? I'm actually curious
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:36): yeah basically whats been working for decades.... eat protein/fat meals every 3hrs
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:36): keep net carbs to under 30g/day
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:37): insulin sensitivity is also lower at night vs the day
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:37) (1x <3): so if you need to eat carbs, you should do it at night
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:37): Hmmmmm 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:37): but if you are keeping carbs low, you dont really need to track calories because nothing will stick to you
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:37): due to low blood sugar and insulin
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:38): i ate 1500 calories worth of nuts last night as a snack
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:38): and didnt gain anything
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 12:41): also, working out on an empty stomach increases lipolysis by 300%
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:41): Awesome
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 12:41): (googling lipolysis)

Nate (2014-02-11 15:41): I thought you hated grouper
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 15:42): That is most certainly a thing. I know a guy who uses it entirely for getting easy lays. 
Nate (2014-02-11 15:43): Couchsurfing?
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 15:43): Yah
Nate (2014-02-11 15:43): Does he host chicks at his place and then bang em?
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 15:43): Yah
Nate (2014-02-11 15:43): Nice
Nate (2014-02-11 15:43): I don't know if I could do that, my place doesn't have extra rooms.  
Nate (2014-02-11 15:44): unless they literally sleep on my couch :)
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 15:44): It helps if u have a BR but in Manhattan ppl aren't too picky
Nate (2014-02-11 15:44): hmm
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 15:44): I've been tempted to do it 
Nate (2014-02-11 15:44): I need to figure out what to do with my expensive shit
Nate (2014-02-11 15:47): not a bad plan though.  built in intimacy
Nate (2014-02-11 15:58): lol this idea gets better the more I research it
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:24): CS? nate
Nate (2014-02-11 16:24): ya
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:24): it seems pretty legit but I'm not seeing many attractive women 
Nate (2014-02-11 16:25): hmm, I never looked at the quality
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:25): I asked the guy who wrote the RP post about it where he looks on the site.. 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:25): I was just searching for locals/travelers
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:25): female age 18-30
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:25): not seeing too many great things
Nate (2014-02-11 16:25): you need to be registered to do that?
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:26): oh yeah
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:27): well I've been a member since 2009 and have a ton of reviews and friends on there
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:27): so this might actually work for me
Nate (2014-02-11 16:27): you hosted?
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:27): yeah 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:27): and surfed

Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:32): but there was this cute german girl that I was flirting with a lot right in front of my gf
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:32): and she was flirting back
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:32): I've banged girls I met at meetups 
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:32): but never a girl that I actually hosted or messaged
Nate (2014-02-11 16:33): Looking through the list now, seems like a lot of decent to good looking chicks
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:34): what list?
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:34): cause I'm just not seeing it
Nate (2014-02-11 16:36): I did a search, clicked host, nyc, female ages 18-35, and whatever default date timespan they picked
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:36): gotcha
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:37): actually seeing a lot better women

Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:39): 3 invites received lol 
Nate (2014-02-11 16:42): I'm looking through and see quite a few.  This looks like fun.  I'll have to think about this and figure out if I can prepare my apartment for it
Nate (2014-02-11 16:47): LOL

Nate (2014-02-11 16:47): She's not that good looking, but her couch surfing memo basically says she wants to fuck whomever she visits
Nate (2014-02-11 16:48) (1x <3): "I think someone who live there must be special,passionate,aggressive."
Phillatio (2014-02-11 16:50): lol wow
Nate (2014-02-11 16:51): yeah :)
Nate (2014-02-11 16:51): So innocent looking too

Phillatio (2014-02-11 17:18): I found four girls I would actually message
Nate (2014-02-11 17:19): I found this asian girl there who had a bunch of guy references, half of which professed their love for her in the review, lol
Phillatio (2014-02-11 17:21): WB?

Phillatio (2014-02-11 17:30): she's pretty cute
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 17:40): She's fuckable.  Not a fan of the huge trunk to be honest.
Nate (2014-02-11 17:40): rimshot!
Phillatio (2014-02-11 17:43): I bet that trunk can suck a mean dick
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 17:46): The nose on that thing
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 17:48): anything would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles, and caresses one and never hurts quite enough
Crepusculum (2014-02-11 17:59): Getting all existentialist on us
Phillatio (2014-02-11 18:04): sent about 7 message

Crepusculum (2014-02-11 18:05): Working on it
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 18:29): Hey Mark, when u said 
" also, working out on an empty stomach increases lipolysis by 300%"Is that a good thing or bad?
TiMex (2014-02-11 18:31): it means you're burning more fat jimmy
TiMex (2014-02-11 18:32) (1x <3): using fat for fuel when you run out of carb energy
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 18:33): Ahhhh
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 18:33): So fasted-state workouts are really good then
TiMex (2014-02-11 18:33): yes
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 18:44): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InRgJx922sc
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 18:45) (1x <3): working out is highly catabolic though, so i would take some BCAAs beforehand if youre gonna do it fasted
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 19:07): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkB9VJdu27M
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 19:28): Dafuq r those
TiMex (2014-02-11 19:29) (1x <3): building blocks of proteins
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 20:38): Got it thx
Jimmyayo (2014-02-11 20:39) (1x <3): Will look for BCAAs at the vitamin shop
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-11 20:41): http://i.imgur.com/MMjvUea.jpg
Nate (2014-02-11 23:04): Hmm. I think I made out in the bar for about 40 mins.  Surprised they didn't say anything.  
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:21): Haha. For Santa con I made out with Lauren's (told you this story) friend in this bar for a while. (This is a bar that Lindsay works at during week- other girl I'm hooking up with). They told us several times to cut it out
Nate (2014-02-11 23:22): I wasn't exaggerating .  We were making out for that whole time straight.  5 mins after I left her she texted me 'I'm in lust with you'
Nate (2014-02-11 23:24): And... lol Nick.
Nate (2014-02-11 23:25): Girl said when she first met me she thought I was a nerd.  I need to get rid of that.
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:26) (1x <3): Monica told me at the Super Bowl party that when she first saw me she thought I was creepy cuz I smiled too much
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:26) (2x <3): Now she loves me
Nate (2014-02-11 23:26): I guess first impressions aren't so important
Nate (2014-02-11 23:27): Isn't she fucking Phil now tho?
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:27): Nope
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:27): Yup
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:27): Yup to fucking Phil
Nate (2014-02-11 23:27): Booo
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:27): Nope to not important
Nate (2014-02-11 23:27): Well that oo
Nate (2014-02-11 23:27): too
Nate (2014-02-11 23:28): Gonna bang thing chick next time.  I'm amazed we didn't fuck this time.  She was really comfortable talking about sex
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:28): All good man. I had to be careful with her. She is good friends with Leah. The Serbian I'm banging
Nate (2014-02-11 23:28): Yeah I understand
Nate (2014-02-11 23:29): Got another date with an 8 Thursday too
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:29) (1x <3): Pamela used to be god friends with her too
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:29): Bit worried about that
Nate (2014-02-11 23:29): Pamela is a bitch ;)
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:30): Haha she is annoying. I am training her though.
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:30): She has a boyfriend in Germany
Nate (2014-02-11 23:30): Not for long...
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:30): Needs to stop being demanding
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:30): Lol
Nate (2014-02-11 23:30): She's too used to getting her way
Nate (2014-02-11 23:30): Needs a bit of domination
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:31): Oh yea. She thinks I'm gonna give up the other girls to hook up with her (told her about them since she has BF). Told her no
Nate (2014-02-11 23:31): lol good
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:32): Might have to cut her off
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:33): Could see her getting jealous
Nate (2014-02-11 23:33): It's funny, on the way back to nyc (got a ride) she was talking about some guy who drover her 3 hrs to an airport.  He was here visiting and she was ignoring his texts
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:35): Oh yea she told me about that too
Nate (2014-02-11 23:35): lol she gave me her number and I texted her and she asked who I was. ;)
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:36): She showed me
Nate (2014-02-11 23:36): Haha.  Obviously she knew who I was
Nate (2014-02-11 23:37): Hey you did say I could go for it, although to be honest I didn't really care
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:38): Def. I didn't know she had a thing for me
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:38): You guys can de go for anyone I bring around.
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:38): Def
Nate (2014-02-11 23:38): Just out of curiosity for future girls.  What did she say about me?
Nate (2014-02-11 23:38): It's okay if it was bad
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:39): Just not interested
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:39): She asked who it was cuz she didn't save your number
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:40): She also didn't understand pea soup comment
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:40): Lost in translation I guess
Nate (2014-02-11 23:40): ahh
Nate (2014-02-11 23:40): Not surprised.  We had no chemistry.
Nate (2014-02-11 23:40): I particularly like the 10 minutes she spent telling me about her eye infection
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:41): Oh god. Better than that she constantly talks about her BF
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:41): I mean I don't care
Nate (2014-02-11 23:41): haha
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:42): And she practically talks about it while we're fucking even
Nate (2014-02-11 23:42): I kinda feel sorry for him.  I knew she'd fuck someone
Nate (2014-02-11 23:42): Yeah that would annoy me tho
Crepusculum (2014-02-11 23:42): ...
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:42): Yea
Nate (2014-02-11 23:42): She had a fantastic body though, so I understand completely
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:43): Haha yea
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:43): Ahmad noticed that rack on Saturday
Nate (2014-02-11 23:43): Yeah I noticed too, hence me asking for her number even if I didn't ever want to hear her talk ;)
Nate (2014-02-11 23:44): I do need to figure out how to up my game.  She should like me even if I didn't like her
Nate (2014-02-11 23:44): To be fair you had much longer to work on her tho
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:45) (1x <3): Dude this was social circle game for me
Nate (2014-02-11 23:45): I know
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:45): I didn't do shit
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:45): Half the girls there would fuck me no joke
Phillatio (2014-02-11 23:45): Best type of game
Nate (2014-02-11 23:45): I could tell she liked you alot tho when I was there
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:46): Ask Ahmad about how many girls were touching me on sat
Nate (2014-02-11 23:46): Well you are: good looking, tall, and social proofed ;)
Nate (2014-02-11 23:46): and the game might be there...
Crepusculum (2014-02-11 23:47): Why don't you just blow him already, Nate
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:47): I have the worst game out of you guys
Nate (2014-02-11 23:47): @Xander I tried.  Need another date
Nate (2014-02-11 23:47) (1x <3): @Timex I doubt it
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:47): Lol
Nate (2014-02-11 23:48): I do think this summer is going to be fucking sick tho.  If my current success ratio of lazy game translates into me actually going out when it's not fucking cold, I'm gonna be swimming in pussy
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:49) (1x <3): Might as well be honest
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:49): Good looking is probably debatable as well
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:49): Some think so
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:50): Others not so much
Nate (2014-02-11 23:50): Well I think you're way better looking than me.
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:50): Yea I do
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:50): I don't get much love on tinder
Phillatio (2014-02-11 23:50): It's probably your age nick
Phillatio (2014-02-11 23:50): No offense
Phillatio (2014-02-11 23:50): Just not your market
Nate (2014-02-11 23:51): Could also be the pics, depends on what you're portraying
Phillatio (2014-02-11 23:51): True story
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:52) (3x <3): It's cool man never had a girl guess over 26 in person
TiMex (2014-02-11 23:52) (1x <3): But tinder puts it out there
Nate (2014-02-11 23:53): Honestly I realized my winter ratio was over 60% number closes off day game approaches.  That's fucking nuts.  I could be the hunchback and that's gonna be insane.
Nate (2014-02-11 23:55): I would like to shed my 'nerdy guy' perception tho...
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 23:55) (2x <3): Decrease ur age on fb
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-11 23:55): Hehe
Nate (2014-02-11 23:55): @Timex I think you'll destroy if you tried day game.  You'll have more numbers than you know what to do with
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-02-11 23:58) (1x <3): Crepusculum has left the group.
TiMex (2014-02-12 00:00): I have to work myself up to that
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 00:05): U will have to remake ur account too
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 00:16) (1x <3): @Nate bit of unsolicited advice - you could/should get a trendier haircut. Getting your haircut from a stylist that knows what he's doing is very much worth the investment. 
Nate (2014-02-12 00:17): You have a place you could recommend?
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 00:21): Negatory, though I would consult Yelp.  Phil goes to a good one IIRC, but also vaguely remember it being quite pricey
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 00:21): I wouldn't recommend my place to non-asians
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 09:40): i spend $20 on my haircut now
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 09:40): its all the same shit after 2 weeks
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 10:11): That's why I cut it every 2 wks
Phillatio (2014-02-12 10:47): oh my goodness guyz

Nate (2014-02-12 12:28) (2x <3): FYI her point about ignoring women who have children... Women who have children don't have as much time to work, so yes bitch, you're gonna make less money
Phillatio (2014-02-12 12:28): she look fat
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:28): Fuck wait.. My right

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:30): Shes kept talking about female inequality

Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 12:33) (1x <3): When engaged in these kinds of arguments, I like to throw in a little line:

-It's just like they say: "you can never win an argument with an idiot, they bring you down to their level and win by sheer experience"
Phillatio (2014-02-12 12:33): stumbled onto that
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:37): Just sent her " i would agree with you but then we'd both be wrong" 
Nate (2014-02-12 12:38): lmao she's so gonna start ignoring you, which is probably a very good thing
Nate (2014-02-12 12:39): I would have sent something dismissive like "You're adorable when you're on your platform"
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:39) (1x <3): yall need better feminist game
Nate (2014-02-12 12:40): won't disagree
Phillatio (2014-02-12 12:40) (1x <3): "You have a lot of feelings"
Phillatio (2014-02-12 12:40): "You remind me of my mother"
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 12:41) (1x <3): ^ someone read CH yesterday 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:41): too many feels, cannot compute

Nate (2014-02-12 12:42): tldr ;)
Phillatio (2014-02-12 12:42): lolz
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:43): Alpha what would u have replied 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:48): depends on your initial interaction
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:49): but something like 'let's discuss over a drink, text message is hardly the ideal medium for this kind of thing'
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:49): Interesting 
Nate (2014-02-12 12:50): I prefer my conversation last night, which ranged from dick sizes, to kissing techniques, to sexual appetites, to dick sucking
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:50): thing with feminists is that feminism is a large part of their identity, and you have to respect that, any dismissive comments means youre done
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:50): (no text) ; photo URL https://i.groupme.com/1080x1551.jpeg.20005100763c0131202522000a2d0ef6
Nate (2014-02-12 12:52): I can maybe stomach one night of feminist agenda garbage before I either put my dick in her mouth to shut her up or delete her number
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 12:53): more for me
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 12:58): @alpha.. My friends say this

 fuck respecting that
put them in their place
he does what i said
"respect, agree, appease"
fuck once or twice
then he gets cycled out
because that shit aint alpha
shes the FEMENIST taking BACK HER SEXUALITY
youre HER conquest, not the other way around
Phillatio (2014-02-12 13:01): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gv-AMiofEI

Nate (2014-02-12 13:06): "Can we please just watch Die Hard"
Nate (2014-02-12 13:12): New Honest trailer for Thor 2.  Great as usual
Nate (2014-02-12 13:13): The best movie line ever "This Jesus shoots rapists...in the dick"
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:14): Hey sorry to disrupt the RP circlejerk for one quick moment, but has anybody taken C4 supplement pre-workout?
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:14): What is that
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:15): http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/cellucor/c4-extreme.html
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:15): Gives you tons of energy apparently
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:16): Gets really good reviews everywhere
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:17): What makes it do that?
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:17): I see creatine which helps
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:17): Dunno about the other stuff
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:17): "effective ingredients including creatine nitrate, Beta Alanine, and Arginine AKG"
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:18) (1x <3): Most supplements are waste of money
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:18): Would you say BCAA + whey protein is a fundamental must?
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:19): I tried to get enough protein from my diet, but there's no way i can get .8g per lb of my own weight from just eating food 
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:20): ON protein contains BCAA already
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:21) (1x <3): http://stronglifts.com/12-strength-training-supplements-dissected/
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:22): I would say your best bet is protein and creatine
TiMex (2014-02-12 13:25) (1x <3): Personally like the ON Natural line of protein
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:28): Chicken has lots of protein. A full chicken breast 300g has 60 grams of protein 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:29): 5 eggs in the morning (3 full, 2 whites)  30 grams
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:29): Hm thx for that link, clears shit up 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:30): Hey Jimmy what's a good pre drink spot near marquee 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-12 13:31): It's kind of a deadzone out there, your best bet is some of the MPD bars

Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 13:37): push over*
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 13:37): you ought to be dominant in all your interactions with women, but there is nuance to it
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:40): Yeah I don't think I was. 
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 13:41) (1x <3): also consider the fact that there are certain hot button topics which are to be avoided
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:41): Just didn't feel like arguing that night, so I think I agree with something she said
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 13:42): Yeah I think that was one
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 13:42) (2x <3): the general principle is that you should avoid any and all conversation topics which do not arouse positive emotion within her

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-12 14:03): http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/official-matters/permits-and-visas/residence-permit
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 14:04): You require a valid work permit in order to work in the Netherlands. This permit provides an employer the right to bring a foreign employee into the country. The employer is responsible for requesting the permit
Alpha Overlord (2014-02-12 14:04): looks like im staying in ny
Phillatio (2014-02-12 14:18): I might go in

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 14:28): *guys guys
Jimmyayo (2014-02-13 14:39) (1x <3): Congrtz
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 14:53): just want to thank the BIG man upstairs and my personal Savior JC
Jimmyayo (2014-02-13 15:37): So how was your marquee-cherry-popping experience
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:40): It was niceee
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:40): Love the ratio
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:41): But haven't been to a club for some time, a little out of practice - 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:44): Drinks are mad expensive so was mostly sober - bought two drinks and stole one so not much drinking was going on - kinda hard to get to Molly level without drinking ;) 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:46): But definitely want to go again. 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:47): I felt chicks weren't as cunty as described 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-13 15:48): Def not. Club chicks get a really bad rap - mostly from guys that don't really go clubbing 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-13 15:51): No I think it's guys that are weird.. And approach weird. 
Phillatio (2014-02-13 17:34): hehehe

Nate (2014-02-13 22:14) (1x <3): Whatever, I'm weeks away from a day game blitz of epic proportions.  When it gets warmer I'm going nuts

Phillatio (2014-02-14 14:23): I look better without one

Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:10): ugh louis CK is the most blue piller motherfucker ever
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:10): if he wasn't so fat and opened his eyes to his SMV he would be much happier

Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:30): http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1xwga8/this_is_the_best_weekend_of_the_year_to_be_a/
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:30): maybe I should go out tonight
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:30): kinda rather smoke pot and watch house of cards
Nate (2014-02-14 15:31): Got a date next weekend to make dinner for a girl.  She explicitly said we're having sex.  I like her :)
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:31): she sounds really special 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): hahah
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): what are you making?
Nate (2014-02-14 15:32): If she wasn't older I'd marry her ;)
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): hahaha
Nate (2014-02-14 15:32): Dunno yet
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): you gotta make something a little light
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:32): Older than u?
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): if the eating is first
Nate (2014-02-14 15:32): Yeah
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): oh wow
Nate (2014-02-14 15:32): If she was 20 she'd be a perfect 10.
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:32): that's totally not your typical 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:33): but she's hit the wall 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:33): or she's going to
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:33): very soon
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:33) (1x <3): Wall = 30 
Nate (2014-02-14 15:33): She has a smoooookin body, and is perfectly fine with me not ever getting serious with her
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:34): oh good
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:34): Begum just sent me a snap chat
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:34): weird 
Nate (2014-02-14 15:34): She has huge perky perfect tits.  I pulled them out at the bar on Tuesday
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:34): Most chicks at the wall aren't down to be a plate, so perhaps she is special
Nate (2014-02-14 15:35): Yeah she's special
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:35): good job Nate
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:35): can we see?
Nate (2014-02-14 15:35): Most of our conversation at the bar was about our sexual likes and dislikes.  We only didn't fuck because she had to pull a double shift in the morning
Nate (2014-02-14 15:36): Don't have a pic.  I'll take care of that when I fuck her next weekend
Nate (2014-02-14 15:36): She's 5'7, blonde
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:36): �
Nate (2014-02-14 15:37): Yeah I hope I keep finding chicks like this
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:38) (1x <3): well I think your SMV is higher than hers
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:38): although this might be fun
Nate (2014-02-14 15:38): She got me hard and then felt my dick to see how it was
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:38): I mean its a ton of fun I'm sure but I think you can do better
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:38): Low hanging fruit can still be tasty
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:39): well I wouldn't call her that
Nate (2014-02-14 15:39) (1x <3): I plan to do better, but I've had a bit of a dry spell lately and she's a lot of fun, and quite hot
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:39): yeah absolutely
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:39): I really want to fuck a girl that's SMV is obviously higher than mine
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:39): I don't think I've ever done that
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:40): I have
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:41): yeah you've definitely had way more success than me Jimmy
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:41) (1x <3): Its good but she pulled me into beta behavior 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:41): That's what really pushed me into redpill theory
(SYS) GroupMe (2014-02-14 15:41): Alpha Overlord has left the group.
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:41): yeah see that's why I want to do it.. to see how I respond
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:42): bye Mark
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:42): I hope mark and xander don't kill themselves 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:42): lol they'll be fine
Nate (2014-02-14 15:42) (1x <3): @Phil I think you're too comfortable using your looks to pull chicks, need to advance yourself
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:42): Haha I know
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:42): yeah see 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:42): I've been thinking lately about the whole looks thing. and I realized it never helps me beyond the first few moments and with online game
Nate (2014-02-14 15:43): I don't think that's true
Nate (2014-02-14 15:43): It helps ALOT with girls who have a lower SMV than you, and doesn't help after the initial approach for girls with a higher SMV
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:44): hmm 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:44): " and I realized it never helps me beyond the first few moments and with online game"

Totally agree
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:44): Beyond that, it requires actual game
Nate (2014-02-14 15:44): That's why Monica was following you around the party at Nick's like a little puppy even before you said much to her
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:44): I said a good amount to her
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:45) (1x <3): I was fucking with her the moment I met her
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:45): and I don't think her SMV is lower than mine probably about the same
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:45): maybe a little lower
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:45): cause shes' 28
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:45) (1x <3): As a friend, no homo - it's at least a little lower
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:45): hahaha
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:46): yeah I suppose
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:46): well I would have never gotten her if I didn't have any game
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:46): but I'm always on auto pilot after a certain point nowadays
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:47): Socio-economic demographic, nationality, height, age 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:47): But she's def very cute
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:47): fah sure
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:47): I would date her
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:47): but I won't
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:48): because I'm not ready for that 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-14 15:49): Yeah u prob want more practice keeping multiple chicks worshipping your cock 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:49): absolutely 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 15:49): I'm definitely not at that level yet
Nate (2014-02-14 15:52): I'm gonna go through Juliens whole program this weekend, now that it's finally out
Nate (2014-02-14 15:57): @phil yeah you have pretty good game too

Phillatio (2014-02-14 16:00): I think she's skinny
Phillatio (2014-02-14 16:00): hard to tell
Nate (2014-02-14 16:00) (1x <3): If I was really drunk
Phillatio (2014-02-14 16:00): meh.
Phillatio (2014-02-14 16:01): okay 
Phillatio (2014-02-14 16:01): maybe I'm not looking close enough

Nate (2014-02-15 12:47): I thought so :)
Nate (2014-02-15 12:50): Any thoughts on what I should say to the girl I made her day to move towards a meeting?  You seem to be on a roll

Jimmyayo (2014-02-15 13:39): He has good witty texts 
Jimmyayo (2014-02-15 13:39): But he can get too gamey

Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 14:56): Jimmy, you kinda have to answer - you can only play with it once

Nate (2014-02-15 15:03): Never known a woman to be truthful about her age anyway
Jimmyayo (2014-02-15 15:03) (1x <3): Well the younger ones will flaunt their youth

Nate (2014-02-15 15:32): I could answer #2 with: Me and drinks, although I think that might be too soon
Nate (2014-02-15 15:37): For the first I'm not sure if I should reward such a thourough answer or not
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 15:45): Tell her to answer the question. 
Nate (2014-02-15 15:46) (1x <3): How about "Use your imagination, and answer"?
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 15:47): Use ur imagination
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 15:47) (1x <3): U don't have to tell her to answer. 
Nate (2014-02-15 15:47): What about the other one.  This one I'm not sure what direction I should take the answer.  I don't really trust my instincts
Nate (2014-02-15 15:48): Thanks, btw :)
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 15:48): Follow Jimmy's script.. 
Nate (2014-02-15 15:49): should I give her a + or - for such a practical answer?

Nate (2014-02-15 16:23): Elisa is getting a +1 and Christina is getting a -1.  Who doesn't choose chocolate?

Phillatio (2014-02-15 20:28): "Go to the bathroom"
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:35): How long r weddings for u jimmy
Nate (2014-02-15 20:37): In my case "depends on who" is a bit of a trap.
Nate (2014-02-15 20:37): Maybe I should say "first instinct" or something
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:42): First instinct still varies from one person to another 
Nate (2014-02-15 20:43): I sure don't want to say me.  Too easy for her to say 'hugs'
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:44): Which do you prefer
Nate (2014-02-15 20:44): kisses
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:44): "which do you prefer receiving" or "which do you prefer" 
Nate (2014-02-15 20:45): ahh :)
Nate (2014-02-15 20:45): good plan
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:45): She might come back 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:45): Again and say depending from who
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:46) (1x <3): But tell her she has no choice in that 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:48) (1x <3): @phil why did you remove the dick pic
Nate (2014-02-15 20:48): he didn't want us to feel inadequate
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:48): @nick how's the birthday thing 
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 20:49): He ain't the only middle eastern in the group ;) 
TiMex (2014-02-15 20:49): just getting ready now, heading over in a bit

Nate (2014-02-15 21:31) (1x <3): Well on the plus side she's really invested
Nate (2014-02-15 21:36): I suppose I should just move along the script, say something like "lol, your answers say quite a lot about you"
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 21:36): Yeah she is. 
Nate (2014-02-15 21:36): Although she's gonna wonder what in her answers says she's at all wicked :)
Mark (Ahmad) (2014-02-15 21:40): Her answer does say a lot about her
Nate (2014-02-15 21:41): yeah that she thinks too much :)

Nate (2014-02-15 22:01): I'm not sure if I should meet for coffee or counter with "How about an evening drink in the upper west side.  I work on the west side so that would be doable" and then suggest a place
Nate (2014-02-15 22:02) (1x <3): *doable after work
